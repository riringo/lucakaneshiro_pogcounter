37:50
one time i went to a
37:52
[Music]
37:54
yes okay let me tell you about it okay
37:56
let me tell you about it
37:57
so one time i went to a job application
38:00
thing
38:02
so so this this this job was basically
38:06
an entertainment job and it was uh
38:10
it was um
38:13
what was it jumping
38:15
it was trampolines it was like a
38:16
trampoline world
38:21
it was like a trampoline world
38:26
yeah it was it was like in the
38:28
old city that i was in
38:31
[Music]
38:34
yeah it was a
38:36
it was a trampoline world
38:38
i forgot what it was called
38:40
but
38:43
so
38:44
i heard that they were you know sending
38:45
out applications
38:47
so so what i did is i emailed them i
38:50
went there myself too gave them like a
38:52
physical copy of it
38:53
and
38:55
yeah
38:55
i waited and it took like two months for
38:58
them to get back
39:01
i i basically forgot about it i forgot
39:03
about it
39:06
it was like a trampoline park uh-huh
39:09
so i
39:10
they got back to me they emailed me
39:12
again
39:13
saying oh we actually have an interview
39:17
stage
39:18
uh soon in in like a week
39:21
would you like to come
39:23
so i'm like yes pog please please and
39:26
wanna know what they said after that
39:29
but
39:30
you got a show
39:33
[Music]
39:35
you gotta you gotta oh what was it i'm
39:37
trying to remember what it was
39:40
they said this isn't uh this is a a job
39:43
where you have to entertain people
39:45
and
39:48
so you need to show something
39:51
to us
39:52
a talent that you can do
39:57
a talent that you can do so i brought
40:00
the my guitar with me
40:03
and as soon
40:05
as soon as i turn the corner
40:09
i see
40:10
literally
40:11
50
40:13
50 people
40:14
[Music]
40:21
i see
40:22
50 people literally just
40:27
applying to
40:30
50 was it 50 yeah it was like fifth
40:32
around 40 to 50 there was so many of
40:35
them
40:36
and
40:37
we basically just sat there for like an
40:39
hour
40:41
and
40:43
by the way like the whole thing took
40:45
eight hours to finish because it was so
40:47
long
40:49
so
40:50
i sat there and they we had like a
40:52
number
40:53
wait no we didn't have a number we had
40:54
names obviously and they would they
40:57
would call us one by one
40:59
and
41:00
what they told us at the beginning they
41:02
said hey
41:03
you know
41:04
you're now to perform to all of these
41:07
people
41:08
in front in front of them what you can
41:11
do and what you can show
41:12
[Music]
41:14
so i was like oh god
41:20
it's like oh no
41:25
i do audition no no it was
41:27
it was for a trampoline park
41:30
i saw like a few people with guitars as
41:32
well
41:33
i saw people with like a magic cup
41:36
stacking
41:38
[ __ ]
41:39
uh
41:41
everything they had everything
41:43
they had like yoga pants and they would
41:44
do like flips and stuff
41:47
and here i am
41:48
just like looking around i'm like ah
41:52
i just wanted a job
41:53
i didn't want to embarrass myself
41:57
you know
41:59
dude i just wanted a job
42:05
i just wanted a job in a trampoline
42:07
place
42:08
and his reasoning as to why he was doing
42:11
that
42:12
the person hiring is because if you you
42:16
know if you can't entertain us
42:19
how the hell are you gonna entertain
42:22
the customers
42:27
so i went up there i was basically like
42:30
the fourth person to go up
42:32
so i didn't have to wait long
42:33
yeah i was the fourth person to go up
42:38
and i just
42:40
yeah i just
42:42
i closed my yeah i i can still remember
42:45
this
42:47
i had to literally close my eyes
42:50
and just
42:53
let it go
42:55
let it go i pretended no one was there
42:59
i wanted a job i really wanted a job
43:04
so i suck it up
43:06
sat down
43:07
and started playing away
43:15
did you get it
43:17
okay after eight hours we had stage two
43:21
okay
43:22
now
43:23
we had to basically host a game
43:27
and to basically host a whole dodgeball
43:30
game
43:32
so
43:33
[Music]
43:36
yeah so
43:38
they wrote my name down
43:40
they did write my name at the end of the
43:42

because of that i i i don't like it
131:26
i don't like it
131:28
chemistry kind of sucks
131:32
i enjoyed physics more than chemistry
131:38
and again i did
131:41
i did all three sciences you know
131:44
i did chemistry biology and physics
131:49
but the thing is i can i i
131:52
i just cannot remember anything from uh
131:56
about chemistry
131:58
probably a little bit of bio but uh
132:01
besides from that
132:03
chemistry is just like gone i really
132:06
didn't like it
132:12
[Music]
132:18
shoes here no no physics was fun okay it
132:21
was it was it was fun to learn
132:24
because it actually made sense
132:28
[Music]
132:32
yeah it made sense
132:34
[Music]
132:36
oh
132:38
oh wait
132:40
a green totoro's hi luca i'm 17 i'm
132:43
trying to go study to japan but feel
132:45
discouraged by people telling me it's a
132:46
huge mistake i want to go to
132:49
go no matter what but it's hard to
132:51
forget what they said what do you think
132:53
oh it depends on who's telling you okay
132:56
one is it your friends telling you that
132:58
are you parents supportive about that
133:01
okay
133:02
if you
133:03
if your friends are telling you not to
133:04
go don't listen to them
133:07
but i'm sorry i'm sorry i have to say
133:08
this okay
133:11
yes
133:12
you're 17.
133:15
once you turn 18 you can do whatever the
133:16
heck you want
133:19
but
133:20
it is it is it's a big decision it
133:22
really is
133:24
it really is
133:26
it really is
133:27
[Music]
133:29
you know
133:30
i don't think
133:32
i don't think i should be the person you
133:33
should be asking about that i think you
133:35
should be asking yourself
133:38
you know
133:40
if you really want to go for it go for
133:42
it but you got to understand there there
133:44
will be some
133:47
i guess like
133:49
there are pros and cons to everything
133:52
you do
133:59
right
134:04
[Music]
134:06
ready
134:09
ask yourself first before you uh
134:12
[Music]
134:14
i mean i i guess you have because
134:17
you're dead set wanting to go
134:20
but again yeah
134:22
[Music]
134:23
i'm not really the right guy to ask it
134:25
you know it's
134:29
it's a big decision it's it's definitely
134:31
a big decision for you
134:33
[Music]
134:38
[Music]
134:42
520 means i love you in chat

i
145:25
that is very useful i would say
145:27
but
145:30
i i think
145:33
yeah it's also useful in the case of
145:35
like

145:38
responsible
145:39
