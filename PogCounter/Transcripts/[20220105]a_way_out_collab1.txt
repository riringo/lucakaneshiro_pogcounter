description

04:01

04:03
oh oh my goodness
04:05
what is happening
04:07
guys you know
04:09
i got a phone call from ike in jail
04:13
this guy
04:16
this guy is in jail again
04:19
and we're here to break him out
04:24
by the way chad uh are me and
04:27
luga
04:28
luca like moving a little bit choppy or
04:30
are we doing okay because i don't know
04:32
if that's obs just messing with me a
04:34
little bit
04:35
free ike
04:37
you look fine on my screen i think
04:40
okay a little it's good
04:44
sort of
04:45
like it's a little slightly choppy
04:48
i wonder if i can fix that somehow or
04:50
maybe it's just the game causing it hmm
04:58
apparently ike is a little choppy
05:00
um that's strange like whenever i tap
05:02
over to obs it looks fine
05:05
but
05:05
the moment i go over to like the game
05:08
it goes like choppy for some reason i'm
05:11
not sure why
05:13
hm
05:17
oh hi yo
05:18
fine for you
05:20
am i a little chumpy on your
05:22
end uh no everything looks fine whenever
05:25
i'm
05:27
whenever i am now
05:29
uh whenever i'm over on
05:31
like uh obs but the moment i switch over
05:34
to a way out it just like
05:36
it goes super choppy
05:39
oh i see
05:42
wait move around real quick
05:45
[Music]
05:48
i think it's i think it's bearable
05:49
enough
05:52
i think it's good
05:55
i i just hope i'm not like now it's
05:57
extremely choppy i wonder why
05:59
i wonder why it does that
06:01
the moment i switch back to obs
06:03
everything's fine i think i'm running
06:05
the game in like
06:06
windowed mode right now
06:09
so i'm not quite sure
06:14
hm mike probably needs to run things in
06:16
admin mode someone says
06:20
really but i'm fairly sure that i am
06:25
but they're saying it's not that bad
06:27
honestly it really isn't that bad i i
06:29
don't think it's
06:31
that bad at all
06:36
maybe if i if i hide the application
06:38
completely
06:41
maybe then can you do that sure what the
06:44
hell
06:46
like if i completely minimize it
06:50
yeah i'm getting rid of every
06:51
application
06:53
i can
06:55
all right
06:57
close tabs
06:59
everything
07:05
all right a bit better now
07:07
oh no
07:09
uh
07:10
i i honestly think it's it's also the uh
07:15
how powerful your pc is
07:18
i do have a pretty good pc though so
07:21
hmm
07:24
maybe it's just this game
07:26
maybe windowed mode for the game helped
07:27
vox earlier but it is in windowed mode
07:30
yeah i'm in borderless
07:32
windowed i think
07:34
uh yeah i'm just in straight up window
07:36
mode
07:38
i should have probably done that
07:42
but it's fine
07:45
uh maybe i'll try minimizing a few apps
07:52
yeah everyone i hope you're all doing
07:54
well
07:55
it's uh wow i woke up
07:58
so oh not early so late today
08:03
literally an hour before the stream
08:10
[Music]
08:14
doom pog nice nice nice
08:22
and by late i mean 9
08:24
am that
08:26
that's pretty late
08:41
9am is late
08:52
you getting it figured out mike i'm i'm
08:54
i'm trying i'm trying my my hardest
08:57
maybe um
08:59
wait does this actually
09:01
is the game being full screen or not
09:03
full screen and really affected that
09:05
much
09:06
i i don't know
09:08
maybe uh
09:10
maybe change it to like
09:13
borderless full screen as well
09:16
uh
09:17
unfortunately i'm like stuck on one
09:19
monitor still so that might oh that
09:22
that's an error
09:24
might be what's causing it i'm not
09:26
entirely sure
09:29
yeah probably i'm trying uh i'm changing
09:30
the bitrate a bit but
09:33
let's see if
09:35
that
09:36
could be doing it
09:39
oh well
09:43
game why are you doing this
09:46
yeah why again why is it doing this
09:50
let's call shoe
09:53
yeah isn't he doing it here
09:55
like a karaoke stream right now
09:58
yeah i think he might be actually
10:06
doesn't want to let free ike listen guys
10:08
this is all a part of the struggle okay
10:11
breaking someone out of jail is not that
10:13
easy
10:16
if this was easy then there would be no
10:18
point eh yeah exactly
10:23
yeah we got to get some
10:25
preparations done pog
10:31
honestly like i i feel like my game will
10:34
lag as well
10:36
cause i have a 10 000 bit rate
10:39
oh my god i keep forgetting to change it
10:50
so uh hopefully hopefully not
10:54
okay let's see where's obs i can change
10:56
it live
10:57
oh
11:03
okay i changed the priority of obs
11:08
so maybe it'll work better now
11:11
hopefully okay
11:17
how are you doing chad how's it looking
