75:29
[Music]
75:37
how many times did you please tell me
75:40
now
75:40
i think the best way to actually earn xp
75:43
is going through the entire map
75:47
is it i thought it was getting kills
75:50
really because you can get xp too by
75:52
exploring
75:53
oh [ __ ] okay we just get a car and just
75:55
drive around the map until yeah
75:59
can't believe that's actually a viable
76:00
solution
76:03
guys for the world guys
76:13
like why are people so obsessed with
76:14
this game it's so easy i know it's so
76:16
