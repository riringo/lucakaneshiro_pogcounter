kidnapped my little sister
22:24
what the hell

the hell that sounds like augustus i'd
22:31
hope to give that to give chase to that
22:33
monster in a ship of my own
22:37
unfortunately all my airships were
22:40
wrecked in the attack
22:45
although
22:46
now that i think about it
22:48
i'm fairly certain there's a functioning
22:49
ship in the next kingdom over
22:52
you can get us there if only i could
22:54
reach the top of that top hat tower
22:57
which is being guarded by the
23:00
the the bowser's monster's henchmen
23:04
you know
23:05
