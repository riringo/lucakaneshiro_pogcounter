you know bart simpson
173:32
the simpsons has has been going on for
173:34
like so many years
173:39
like how does bot simpson have the same

how come ash
174:12
you know pokemon's been airing for like
174:14
how long 20 years now

how come ash the voice actor never grew
174:32
up you ever thought about that
174:41
they're voiced by women

174:46
sense
174:56
holy [ __ ]
175:02
dude it's kind of pog what the hell
175:06
oh that makes so much more sense thank
175:08

175:35
come on you guys thought of that too
175:36

177:55
kid
178:02
osana
178:14
they get different kids to voice ash

178:52
20 years chad

i hope i
269:55
i hope i'm right with that
269:57
i'm gonna i'm gonna have to break my
269:59
schedule for it
270:01
i have to wake up at like 12 a.m and
270:03
then start streaming
270:06
literally midnight
270:08
till
270:08
the morning
270:12
hello hi
270:18
12 a.m yeah yeah i think it releases 12
270:21
a.m night time so
270:23
yeah it's gonna suck but
270:25
let's we're gonna enjoy ourselves it's
270:27
fine
270:30
am i feeling better now boss yeah of
270:31
course
270:32
i don't really have
270:35
a stuffed nose anymore
270:39
can you keep awake i think i can all i
270:40
have to do is basically sleep early and
270:42
then wake up
270:44
and i'll be good
270:55
how did you even manage to wake up i
270:57
don't know i've never waken up at that
270:59
time for like
271:02
years now
271:10
i used to have a really bad schedule
271:12
like i i would wake up at like 1am
271:16
oh yeah
271:18
there was a time where like
271:21
my internet would actually run out
271:23
and
271:24
i would have to wake up at like 12 a.m
271:30
so basically from 12 a.m 7 a.m
271:33
there's like free internet
271:35
free like literally free internet but
271:38
when it runs out you can't use it you
271:40
can't use anything from 7am all the way
271:43
till like 12 a.m
271:45
so
271:46
only in those seven hours you can
271:48
actually
271:49
you know use the internet
271:51
so
271:51
i would break my schedule
271:54
download a lot of anime
271:57
you know play games during that
272:04
time and then so
272:08
when it's the uh
272:10
after 7 a.m i can start watching the
272:12
anime that i downloaded
272:14
hopefully
272:16
and then i'd do it all over again
272:31
yeah it really sucked it sucked it
272:33
doesn't happen anymore though
272:41
