[Music]
15:53
i'm glad you came to my rescue my new
15:55
friend from the sky
15:57
[Music]
15:59
i tried catching my little runaways by
16:01
tossing some pokeballs their way but i'm
16:02
not the best
16:03
at this sort of thing you see
16:07
i'd like to give you a go at it but
16:08
perhaps i should tell you a bit about
16:10
these three firsts
16:13
now that one is relevant
16:15
[Music]
16:17
welcome before can photosynthetic
16:21
photosynthesis size
16:23
like a plant and apparently it battles
16:25
using its sharp feathers oh okay
16:33
[Music]
16:37
jen i might pick cinderella i don't know
16:39
what do you think
16:40
that one over there is cyndaquil
16:44
it's in the park usher pog poglet
16:47
thank you manga
16:51
boom
16:56
that pokemon near the pond is asha what
17:00
naps while floating on the water and it
17:02
can battle using the shell-like object
17:04
on its belly
17:07
flash
17:10
oh my i nearly forgot to cover the most
17:12
crucial thing how to go about catching
17:14
pokemon
17:14
[Music]
17:16
you are my boy
17:18
pokeballs 30's at pokemon to catch him
17:21
[Music]
17:22
50
17:23
[Music]
17:27
what
17:29
[Music]
17:31
but
17:33
that won't do for an explanation will it
17:35
i do apologize let me be more thorough
17:38
now mention that already that
17:40
i've mentioned already that pokemon are
17:42
strange marvelous creatures
17:45
what's so strange about them you ask
17:48
well
17:49
each and every pokemon is able to shrink
17:51
itself down to a minuscule size
17:54
and that's where pokeballs come in
17:57
a very recent invention you see throw
17:59
one of the pokemon into pokemon throw
18:01
one of them out of pokemon and
18:04
why the pokemon will shrink it down and
18:06
fit inside the ball comfy as can be
18:08
and with that you've caught a pokemon
18:14
i know we've just met but i'm afraid of
18:16
no one else to turn to
18:18
i'd be great awfully grateful if you
18:20
could catch my three runaways
18:22
now the proper technique is to aim at
18:24
the pokeball pokemon and then let the
18:25
ball fly okay ready i got this laventon
18:31
i've got you
18:33
hold the zia buns ready
18:37
release
18:40
okay chat
18:43
[Music]
18:52

18:55
where where are you
18:56
going
19:00
[Music]
19:08

pokemon catching business luka

19:37
to have around here what that's a skill
19:40
throwing pokeballs
19:45
you didn't see fifa pokemon in the
19:46
slightest no not at all
19:53
[Music]
20:02

20:06

20:09
you know many people fear to even
20:10
approach pokemon never mind catch them
20:12
bravo indeed so i'm gonna go
20:17
[Music]
20:32
wait what the hell
20:35
ah yes i'm afraid that can happen
20:38
pokemons are hardly 100 foolproof give
20:41
it out of the goat oh boy
20:43
[Music]
20:45
wait where did wella go
20:51
chad you want to know something
20:55
thank you for the super chat thank you
20:56
thank you uh
20:58
wanna know something
21:01
i'll tell you once we catch relic
21:04
yes okay
21:07
what
21:08
why don't they just make a perky ball
21:11
that's like a hundred percent all the
21:14
time
21:19
and mass producer
21:22
have you ever thought about that
21:31
have you ever thought about that
21:34
they're hard to make
21:36
[Music]
21:42
thank you very much indeed oh what a
21:44
relief to have them all back
21:46
you see the three pokemon you've caught
21:47
have only arrived in the village to help
21:49
for the hour
21:50
our research they won't listen to anyone
21:54
yeah they're master balls but like they
21:56
can't be that hard to make right
22:00
[Music]
22:02
as i mentioned they bolted from the
22:03
village almost as if
22:05
they knew you'd become falling
22:13
i must say luca i was thinking about how
22:15
well you use those pokemon i'm a natural
22:18
chad
22:20
thank you for the super chat uh how is
22:22
it that you catch pokemon so ably when
22:24
you've only just arrived here
22:26
one can help can't help but think
22:28
there's a reason you appear in there now
22:30
[Music]
22:38
seek out all pokemon that object is an
22:41
arc phone you say
22:43
what an odd device could it be guiding
22:44
you somehow
22:46
[Music]
22:48
if you'll indulge me for a moment
22:49
there's something i'd like to share with
22:50
you
22:51
you see i have a dream to compile this
22:52
region's first complete record of its
22:54
pokemon
22:56
we in the field call it such a catalog
22:59
way in the field called such a catalog
23:01
of perky decks
23:02
that's probably pokedex's wonderful work
23:04
of research containing all detail
23:06
containing detailed records of all why
23:08
am i reading this so fast i can't
23:13
but in order to properly document
23:15
pokemon one must of course catch them
23:17
[Music]
23:19
and they're in lines to rub i'm afraid
23:22
pokeballs have only just been invented
23:24
and not many have mastered his skill of
23:26
using them
23:29
enter you a person with a clear talent
23:32
for catching pokemon
23:35
your goal is to seek out every pokemon
23:37
and your mind is to have all those
23:39
pokemon caught
23:41
our situations right the teamwork don't
23:44
you agree
23:46

23:48

[Music]

the wall flowers for galaxies
27:53
galaxy team [ __ ] only
27:56
we don't have seats for outsiders move
27:57
along what the hell
28:03
i'm searching
28:09
who are you
28:10
i've never seen anyone dress like you
28:13
are
28:16
uh what if you're attacked by a pokemon
28:20
could be minced meat in those flimsy
28:22
clothes
28:24
if the garlic you threw you must have
28:26
ties with somebody in the village god my
28:28
voice is killing me
28:32
perhaps
28:35
perhaps you've
28:38
met professor levinson
28:40
oh
28:41
he's a scholar from a far away place
28:45
his pokemon to get away with him from
28:48
him at times though
28:49
it makes me a bit worried for him
28:52
i suppose
28:53
i hardly want to talk
28:55
i've
28:56
had some trouble with pokemon myself
28:59
i was hit by a pokemon move called
29:01
thundershot not long ago
29:04
and i had to take to my bed
29:06
but the professor well
29:08
i do wonder how long he'll last
29:13
unfortunately it's wait unfortunately
29:16
it's just
29:17
as akari says
29:19
i'm a clumsy sort of fellow to put it
29:21
mildly
29:22
a professor
29:24
she's pogging
29:27
but everything will be quite all right
29:29
now
29:30
luka here has agreed to help us with our
29:32
pokedex
29:37
excuse me
29:38
you plan to appoint him to be the survey
29:40
to survey corpse
29:45
you can't just slap a badge on whoever
29:46
you like without captain celine's
29:49
permission
29:53
wait
29:57
uh
29:58
a captain's lean
30:01
uh assuming the individual can
30:04
contribute to the survey court that is
30:07
i am the captain of the galaxy team
30:09
survey corps you may call me celine
30:14
attack on titan
30:19
professor levinson has told me how you
30:22
helped secure his pokemon when they
30:23
slept in his control
30:25
and now it seems he would like to
30:27
you would like us to feed and house you
30:30
in exchange for
30:34
hey give me a second chad
30:36
give me a second i just woke up
30:41
in exchange
30:42
for your ongoing labor
30:46
[Music]

30:56
wide old enough to work for your own key

30:59
chad not 10.
31:03
not 10.
31:04
finally
31:12
not
31:13
well we can simply take on a stranger we
31:15
can't simply take on a stranger who
31:17
wanders in
31:18
among us
31:21
without any
31:23
any idea of their
31:25
skills or origins
31:27
[Music]
31:30
tomorrow we shall see if you can prove
31:32
yourself worthy

32:58
guy's
33:00
ah
33:04
robinson what exactly did you mean i'm
33:05
visiting here
33:07
oh well you know of the great hole in
33:09
the sky the one people call the
33:10
space-time rift
33:12
a new friend fell right out of it
33:18
can't be serious
33:20
[Music]
33:24
come now i am a scientist
33:27
my job is to observe and explain any
33:30
observe and explain any and all
33:32
phenomena
33:34
i concern myself with only facts
33:38
you like this game so if i'm glad
33:40
uh now you already
33:41
know there are many pokemon here and
33:43
there's hissui in this missouri region
33:45
okay
33:46
all right by water wherever they like my
33:49
job was as a survey a survey card
33:52
is to research them and find out what
33:54
kind of creatures they are
33:58
well you know this much
34:00
pokemon are terrible
34:02
terrifying
34:04
creatures
34:07
it's all but impossible to know what
34:08
kinds of powers they might possess or
34:10
what sorts of wondrous things they can
34:12
do
34:15
that's where luca will come in
34:19
you successfully caught three pokemon
34:20
three of them in quick order you
34:22
understand
34:23
nobody in the galaxy team is capable of
34:25
a feat such as that this means we can
34:27
finally begin our pokemon research in
34:30
the earners ernest
34:35
we have a hard enough time catching even
34:37
one when the wild pokemon come after us
34:41
oh well
34:42
to be perfectly fair the pokemon that
34:45
fled to the beach went on the attack
34:48
but the key to catching pokemon is
34:49
getting close enough to aim your pokemon
34:51
well pokemon well
34:54
it seems our new friend here is fearless
34:57
enough to do just that
35:04
does the survey core really have leeway
35:06
to be enjoying a
35:08
a leisurely
35:10
meal with this outsider
35:14
your captain just ordered ten whole
35:16
potions of potato machi you know
35:18
the slow progress in that pokemon goes
35:20
clearly has
35:24
why does this guy hate me so much
35:30
i'm sure we'll start to reign in a good
35:32
captain stress eating soon enough okay
35:36
now have you feel luca
35:38
and think if you make it to team the
35:40
galaxy team you'll never have to worry
35:42
about a meal again
35:44
the team provides for all its members
35:46
needs even if said members fell out of
35:48
the sky
35:55
okay
35:56
fair hi emma thank you
36:02
i can't believe cyrus got also got
36:04
isight and jennifer
36:11

36:15
more importantly
36:17
did you remember luke has a trial to
36:18
pass
36:20
did you in a survey court don't you
36:23
not to worry
36:24
i have complete confidence in lucas
36:26
skills
36:27

luca was it
36:34

36:37
we will provide you with a place to
36:39
sleep
36:45

36:48
you tomorrow you must move on
36:50
you will be expelled from the village
36:52
and to meet your fate
36:54
and perhaps your death in the wild why
36:56

to provide for those who only take
46:05
without giving
46:06
[Music]
46:08
if you wish to say you must prove beyond

80:27
you need to work on your sumo technique
80:28
but i do see some potential
80:35
don't expect a warm welcome from
80:36
everyone naturally some will be slow to
80:39
trust an outsider like you
80:41
who literally fell right out of the
80:45
all right the blue
80:46
among us
80:49
he said the thing it might see your
80:51
arrival as a portion of disaster
80:55
but you passed a trial that was put upon
80:57
you
80:59
no matter how odd how old you may seem

you're part of the jubilee village now

galaxy expedition team
81:10

complete
81:34
i just got a monastery like literally
81:36
among us
81:39
so the commander has also accepted you
81:43
for understand this you begin as a
81:45
no-star recruit among our ranks
81:48
in other words i have no rank at all
81:52
i perform well as a member of the survey
81:54

81:56
ranks
81:58
[Music]

recipe for crafting but wait we have to

82:37
materials

82:50
know
82:52
of course captain celine
82:54
now
82:55
as the experienced crafters person here
82:58
let me explain a bit to start with
83:00
crafting means making items with your
83:02
own two hands
83:04
you can buy some items at the general
83:06
store but self-sufficiency is worth
83:08
striving for
83:13
we can even make our most valuable tools
83:15
pokeballs
83:17

the details of these tasks can be found

pokemon species and carry out plenty of
90:59
research tasks
91:02
it's too early
91:04
in the morning for this

91:08
it's too early in the morning that
91:10
you know i'm thinking about things like
91:12
these you know
91:14
one last piece of advice luka
91:16
if you see a wild pokemon attack coming
91:18
your way dodge like your life depends on
91:21
it
91:23
why
91:24
here watch closely and remember what i
91:27
do so you can do it later
91:30
[Music]
91:36
ah dark souls roll
91:39
[Music]
91:41
that beautiful slowing bit of gymnastics
91:44
is what we call a dodge
91:48
if you're light on your feet you can
91:49
touch out out of the way of wild pokemon
91:52
attacks
91:54
that way hoping hopefully you can avoid
91:56
taking a beating and blacking out in the
91:58
wilderness
92:01
the security corps had to collect me
92:04
when i got

the sky people may be more willing to
124:18
accept you

working your way through the ranks will
124:22
also be a help if you wish to make a
124:24
life for yourself here

131:42
oh by the way the pro professor said
131:44
pokemons have things called types which
131:46
apparently
131:48
uh make a big difference in how battles
131:51
go
131:52
okay of course i know this already
131:55
i'm a pokemon champion chad
131:58
i know exactly what it is
132:02
so you're the one that you recruit
132:04
everyone's been talking about
132:07
oh
132:12
the name zizu the captain of the
132:14
security corps
132:19
uh
132:20
i see you've got some fighting you
132:23
figured i'd stop by and give
132:25
give what advice i could
132:28
patency is a master of an ancient
132:31
martial art one that specializes in
132:33
pokemon battles
132:37
now listen
132:39
if your pokemon truly mastered its moves
132:41
it can actually use them in different
132:43
styles
132:45
she's
132:46
big on the other hand you can choose to
132:49
deliver a move in the strong style
132:52
the move will deal more damage but
132:53
afterwards it'll take longer for your
132:55
pokemon to act
132:59
on the other hand you can choose to
133:00
unleash a move in the agile style
133:03
such a move will have less power behind
133:05
it but your pokemon can act more quickly
133:07
afterwards
133:09
in truly favorable favorable conditions
133:12
it might even get out
133:14
two moves before the opponent can act ah
133:19
strong silence
133:22
strong style moves agile style moves and
133:24
of course regular style moves
133:28
choose which is right forgive us
133:31
and direct your pokemon with a little
133:32
notch
133:33
my god
133:37
the way
133:39
the way the text box
133:41
works in this game is so confused i
133:43
don't know why it's so confusing
133:51
one more thing if you want us to teach
133:52
your pokemon some powerful moves just
133:54
let me know
133:59
these teachings should serve you well
134:01
when you're up against tough pokemon
134:03
now i suppose it's time i want to meet
134:05
my
134:06
remember i mentioned that the wallflower
134:08
that i could use your help with mine's
134:10
requested i'm to meet her down past the
134:13
foot of the aspiration hill
134:16
you should come as well once you've
134:17
readied your pokemon team and perhaps
134:19
have had them learn some new moves from
134:21
zizu if you'd like
134:24

144:12
lord lord it is said
144:15
to have created the very universe using
144:17
its power
144:19
over time's flow
144:21
and this land of hisoi was born in the
144:23
process
144:26
it's by the grace of almighty sinnoh
144:28
that
144:29
pokemon can live and thrive here
144:33
we
144:34
of the diamond clan are descendants of a
144:36
people who cross the sea and settled

144:59
but there is still pokemon here today in
145:00
isui with a connection to almighty
145:03
sinner

145:07
attend to their needs
145:10
the pokemon that graces did track
145:13
heights is one of those honored few

it's a miracle you showed up on time oh
169:13
mighty the leader of the pearl clan

171:29
corps
171:30

171:37
like
171:39
oh up there
171:44
[Music]
171:50
right here we go chad
171:53
finally
171:58
what do you intend to do about the
172:00
cleveland commando commodore
172:02
he may be a descendant from a warrior of
172:04
almighty sinnoh but look at the mess
172:06
he's causing we can't sit back and let
172:08
him rage on
172:10
you do get it right
172:12
you do get right to the point ottoman
172:16
time wasted is lost
172:19
well tell me what you would have us do
172:22
cleaver is a precious learned apparel
172:23
clan
172:24
is he not
172:28
that's the point my clan can't intervene
172:31
directly with a lord of the pearl clans
172:33
concerned
172:34
if my people were to do something our
172:36
two clans might end up back at each
172:37
other's throats
172:39
it's like we used to be
172:41
[Music]
172:43
but even the folk at the galaxy team
172:45
have been wounded haven't they seems
172:47
someone's got to do something here
172:51
hey i don't know you free on set
172:53
whoa chad
172:55
know that
172:58
would the diamond clan have
173:00
have the pearl clan bring down one of
173:02
its own honored nobles
173:06
i don't believe i said that about it
173:07
maybe
173:10
you might as well have said it you fool
173:12
look we didn't even know what drove the
173:14
lord clearance to such violent frenzy
173:21
i like to know that myself this this is
173:23
the first as far as my client knows too
173:27
i see you're right
173:30
let's look at the newest member of our
173:31
survey core
173:35
i hear from my you earned weird ears
173:38
favor
173:40
good to finally meet you stranger from
173:41
the rift i thought he was talking about
173:43
me chad he doesn't want me around
173:51
i'm adamant
173:52
leader of the diamond clan
173:54
if you want to be formal
173:56
that's just a mouthful
173:58
mouthful
174:00
let's call me adamant
174:03
goodnight casama
174:07
you think so
174:10
i look pretty punk too chad what the
174:12
hell
174:14
leader the pokemon caution and foresight
174:16
of my watch words
174:18
which is why i have trouble believing
174:19
such a tale
174:20
did you really have passed through that
174:22
rift yeah i did
174:27
i have a proposition why not send this
174:28
one to study cleaver before deciding
174:31
what must be done
174:35
you'd send a stranger
174:37
you supposedly fell from the river to
174:39
study cleaver this newcomer with no
174:41
experience
174:43
says the leader with almost no
174:46
experience
174:51
being a good leader is a matter is it a
174:52
matter of time it's a math god it's so
174:54
many tags
174:56
i'm sold commander let's try this your
175:00
way this should be fun i'll get to see
175:03
how good you are
175:04
you galaxy folk
175:06
really are
175:07
with all your weird ways putting pokemon
175:09
in those strange balls and what have you
175:12
what the [ __ ] am i right
175:15
that whole practice bothers me
175:20
almighty no made visually fast so
175:22
pokemon could live freely throughout
175:24
we're meant to stand alongside pokemon
175:27
not count ourselves above them
175:31
we do not use pokeballs from a desire to
175:34
control our pokemon
175:36
only so that we can live together allow
175:38
us to show you what we can do
175:42
this is your mission now luca i order
175:44
you to study cleaver and help us find
175:46
the truth of this situation
175:49
i accept
175:51
[Music]
175:53
remember that you are a stranger who
175:55
appeared one day appeared one day out of
175:57
the very sky above us people are very
175:59
naturally suspicious of your presence
176:01
here
176:02
if you wish to be fully accepted and
176:03
trusted you must work hard work yourself
176:05
to the very bone
176:09
well that's settled uh there's no time
176:11
like the present
176:13
now lord of the woods cleaver is
176:15
descended from a pokemon that was
176:16
blessed with almighty sinnoh's own power
176:19
no other pokemon uh you've yet
176:21
encountered can compare to his strength
176:23
be warned
176:30
listen to me
176:32
the galaxy x expedition team has come to
176:34
this history region as a group of
176:36
outsiders some might even call us
176:38
interlopers
176:40
we mustn't do anything to threaten our
176:42
relations with the uh
176:44
diamond and pearl clans understand yup
176:51
take me downstairs luka we'll cover the
176:53
details of this new mission
177:00
i didn't i honestly like didn't even
177:02
think this game would be like fully
177:05
story driven if that makes sense
177:09
seems like it is though
177:21
oh good you're already here
177:25
professor levinson the briefing if you
177:27
please
177:30
yes let's get right to it so luca i
177:32
understand you've been requested to find
177:34
out the clause of cleaver's frenzy state
177:37
but i'll see if you don't know where by
177:38
now cleaver is a mighty thing now
177:40
invincible even
177:42
security court tried
177:44
throwing pokeballs at cleaver when they
177:46
were attacked what the hell is the
177:47
cleaver
177:50
i'm afraid i didn't even come close to
177:51
catching him
177:53
it seems he's a far trickier opponent
177:55
than even those aggressive species of
177:57
pokemon that cannot
177:59
and uh
178:02
that cannot be caught outside of battle
178:04
once they're riled
178:09
it's a new new pokemon
178:13
okay
178:16
this mission will put you in extreme
178:17
danger do you believe you can handle it
178:20
yes of course i can of course i can
178:23
very well
178:24
then let us go over the particulars
178:27
diamond and pearl clans for fear their
178:29
nobles because they believe these
178:31
pokemons serve their almighty sinnoh
178:34
they leave offerings express gratitude
178:37
to these pokemons in locations they call
178:39
the noble seats
178:42
so perhaps a good starting
178:48
oh god
178:54
luka
178:55
we need to speak with you
178:58
listen that rift in time space-time
179:00
seems like it connects this world to a
179:02
whole other world
179:06
the world might be where almighty center
179:08
itself for science the true medicine
179:10
that is
179:15
the one that rules every time
179:18
so if you fell through the space-time
179:19
rift that mean that might mean you
179:21
travel through time by all mighty
179:23
sinners own power
179:24
think of it
179:26
you must have been swimming and it's in
179:28
its divine might
179:29
well
179:30
i've got a favor to ask of you oh
179:32
amazing time traveler
179:35
don't just study cleaver
179:37
quell his frenzy
179:40
well he certainly caught us to get a
179:42
good time young adamant
179:44
we will just discover discussing our
179:47
next steps uh
179:51

those pearl clan types have a lot of
180:18
respect for cleaver you heard his title
180:20
lord of the woods

i'm sure they'd rather get this under
180:23

180:25
come right out and ask those of the
180:28
galaxy team of all people for help
180:30
[Music]

how could this be

i mean defeat been defeated but oh my
219:15
point still stands it's too dangerous to
219:17
meet cleaver right now
219:19
well that's that's for me to decide
219:22
bruh
219:25
no xp
219:28
normally i'd simply try making
219:31
him an offering
219:32
a nice
219:34
a nice heaped helping okay i don't know
219:37
what i'm reading chad i have no i
219:40
even i clever's loyal warden can't get
219:42
close enough to give any offerings now
219:44
oh with the way cleaver is rampaging and
219:46
running amok
219:52
the ancestors of cleave are weird here
219:54
and
219:55
no no no it's sad
219:58
it's by their grace that are crammed any
220:00
of us still lives in fast history today
220:08
what are you doing here
220:14
as you say cleaver's grown even stronger
220:17
but i'm afraid that strength but poses a
220:20
problem for us
220:22
if he was indeed struck by that
220:23
lightning
220:25
did the pulse have been sent by the
220:26
false sinnoh
220:29
could the bolts have been sent by the
220:31
full sinnoh that the diamond clan bows
220:33
to
220:50
i'm sir chad do you understand that what
220:52
the what the hell did i just read
220:59
believe it means so much to our clan i'd
221:01
hoped we could bring this situation
221:02
under
221:04
[Music]
221:17
i i think i'm reading it too fast
221:23
we must save cleaver from this frenzy
221:25
every moment it continues the danger
221:26
grows
221:27
if more people in perk
221:35
if more people in pokemon are attacked
221:36
it will lead to conflict with both the
221:37
diamond clan and the galaxy team okay
221:40
good
221:41
good now i can't understand it again
221:43
[Music]
221:48
first time visiting hi hello hello
221:52
can an outsider actually find a way to
221:54
quell our lord's frenzy
221:57
i'll figure it out
222:03
very well
222:04
liam and i will gather foods that please
222:07
cleaver
222:08
in hopes that we might be able to get
222:10
close enough to make him a proper
222:12
offering
222:13
as for you
222:14
find a way to quell his frenzy even if
222:16
you must search every corner of fast
222:18
history
222:25
oh a call from the god
222:32
mysterious power now enables you to
222:34
return to base camps
222:36
fast travel
222:43
fast travel chat
222:47

223:16
expect
223:18
oh is that so now that's quite a tidbit
223:20
so serving his favorite food will
223:22
normally make cleave aquatic really
223:24
agreeable is that it
223:26
okay
223:27
alrighty
223:30
how much money for that chat
223:32
2509 nice
223:35
[Music]
223:41
nice
223:42
when can i be ranked too
223:52
so according to the information you were
223:54
able to learn from iridar and leonard
223:56
the pearl clan
223:58
where the where where where this
224:04
were this a normal course of events that
224:06
frenzy cleaver would be calmed by a nice
224:08
serving of his two favorite foods
224:13
i do
224:14
wonder is it possible the aromas of some
224:17
other components of these foods might
224:19
combine in a way that can only calm
224:21
cleaver but draw
224:23
[Music]
224:31
oh god
224:35
give me a moment if you would i need
224:36
some time to ponder on this
224:38
this ought to be something in my
224:40
research nerds that can help us
224:53
he's thinking he's thinking
224:55
let's see
224:57
[Music]
225:00
eureka
225:05
we'll simply have to throw the food
225:20
really
225:22
that's it
225:25
it took him so long to think of that
225:27
[Music]
225:36
okay oh okay
225:38
you know what good job good job
225:41
blevinson i would never have thought of
225:43
that
225:44
[Music]
225:47
why would i suggest you to take clever's
225:50
favorite foods and
225:51
make sense
225:55
i would never have thought of that
225:57
what a genius
226:04

226:06
to myself
226:08
what about tea time balls

afternoon tea does it not

why wouldn't you simply call them
226:20
lavinton balls professor
226:23
oh my with that name it would sound like
226:26
i'm the one being launched at our
226:27
frenzied friend
226:30
in any case we can rely on the pearl
226:32
clan to gather necessary food stuff
226:33
correct
226:40
then you should get back to the grand
226:41
tree arena and let the pearl clan know

if you're off the grand tree arena best
226:46

i only found that out recently too
248:59
like uh
249:01
like
249:02
november last year
249:07
i thought it was fish the entire time
249:13
and when when i talk to my friend it's
249:16
like oh
249:18
like oh they were like oh what did you
249:19

249:26
no hash browns on fish it's it's
249:39
even till now i'm very very surprised

249:44
because i didn't like
249:45
again i told you okay i chad i told you
249:48
how much i don't like
249:51
i don't i don't i don't really like fish
249:53
besides salmon i don't like fish that's
249:56
why i stayed away from from uh
249:58
hashbrown i didn't eat hashbrown for the
250:00
longest time because i thought it was
250:02
fish
250:06
[Music]
250:12
[Music]
250:14
it tastes like fish
250:16
churn it looks like fish
250:23
is it not
250:31
hashbrowns yeah
250:35
you literally bite into it and it looks
250:36
like fish meat that's what it looks like
250:49
and the white stuff inside like hash
250:51
browns it looks like fish meat that's
250:54
what i thought that's why i thought that
250:57
my mom told me it was fish
251:16
what
251:18
the text shot yeah it's similar too what
251:20
do you mean
251:24
okay okay okay okay chat chat chat chat
251:27
chat
251:30
you go to your local fish and chips
251:32
place right now and buy fish and chips
251:34
okay
251:35
get rid of the fries
251:38
put put the fish
251:40
on the table okay now go to mcdonald's
251:43
and buy hash browns and put them side by
251:46
side they look the same you cut them in
251:48
half they look the same
251:58
they look the same
252:13
come on
252:14
they look the same
252:15
they're both fried
252:20
that's like the main reason why i
252:21
thought they would it was fish all along
252:31
the only similarity is the color
252:34
the texture too i think
252:45
maybe you just need to sleep um no no
252:49
it's only 4am
252:51
[Music]
253:01
what kind of effed up hash brands are
253:02
you eating the macas one
253:05
like the mcdonald's mac mcdonald's hash
253:08

253:09
those ones
253:10
that's the only hashbrowns i've ever
253:12
eaten in my life
253:24
yeah mcdonald's one they're pretty good
253:28
honestly i i don't i don't eat them
253:30
still
253:32
because they look like fish to me
253:35
hash browns still look like fish to me
253:37
so i choose not to eat it but if it's
253:39
that i will uh you know
253:41

253:48
their taste of feel like fish
253:51
