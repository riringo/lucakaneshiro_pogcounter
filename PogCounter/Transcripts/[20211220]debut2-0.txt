[Music]
18:46
uh
18:50
do slash did you have any pets if so i'd
18:53
be interested to hear about them if you
18:54
don't do you have do you want one or do
18:56
you plans
18:58
do you have plans to get one in the near
19:00
future uh
19:02
well the only pet i've had so far is
19:04
this guy
19:06
behind me
19:08
aside asides from that um i've never
19:10
really had a pet
19:12
the the one time i actually did i had
19:14
like a bird
19:16
and what happened to the bird was the
19:18
bird i trusted it i was like seven years
19:20
old i love this bird it was a little
19:22
parrot
19:24
one day
19:26
one day
19:28
i
19:29
trusted the birds so much i went outside
19:32
with it and never came back
19:34
yeah that's what happened
19:36
that is what happened
19:39
i went outside and
19:41
it never came back
19:44
yep
19:45
so i waited for like a couple of days
19:47
and her and hopes that he would actually
19:49
come back but
19:50
he never did
19:52
he never did
19:54
why did he hate me that much
20:07
okay
20:07
[Music]
20:09
but do i plan on getting one in the
20:10
future though ah
20:14
probably i'll probably get a cat
20:20
my bird flu also flew away relatable oh
20:22
no
20:25
i actually saw a parrot outside of my
20:26
house a month ago oh god

okay
20:34
[Music]
20:36
what's up what's your workout routine
20:38
the audience needs to know
20:41
first
20:42
wake up every two days run outside
20:46
wake up at like 7 a.m
20:48
start running
20:51
give it like a whole month hey your legs
20:53
will be turned
20:58
not only that
21:00
do planks every single
21:03
day
21:06
and don't start counting until it hurts
21:09
right
21:10
that's
21:11
that's my advice
21:14
how long do we run um
21:17
i don't know i mean you don't even have
21:18
to run you you can just like
21:20
walk really fast for probably an hour
21:24
that burns more
21:28
[Music]
21:32
yeah
21:32
[Music]
21:35
yeah if you actually just walk like a at
21:37
a very fast pace
21:38
for a long period
21:40
period of time
21:43
[Music]
21:46
that's it yeah it's uh
21:48
[Music]

21:52
about that

50:35
i've seen people
50:37
i've seen people say that
50:39
you know
50:40
ah i'm not very confident i'm probably
50:42
gonna fail it so they end up not
50:44
auditioning in the first place a lot of
50:46
people say that but some people all
50:48
actually get in you know but
50:51
again
50:52
again
50:54
you shouldn't just apply
50:57

50:59
hope to get in
51:00
uh if you really really want to get in
51:03
yes please please apply

55:17
well
55:18
let's minimize that a little bit
55:22
um
55:23
actually yeah i think this is a good
55:25
time to actually tell you how i even
55:26
found out about nigisanji so a year ago
55:30
uh
55:31
i was looking around for male youtubers
55:33
and i couldn't find any right so i went
55:36
on youtube
55:38
and i think it was like 7pm at night and
55:40
i saw
55:41
ibrahim senpai
55:44
a guy had like 30 000 viewers i was like
55:46
what holy house is possible
55:50
so i was very motivated but what i did
55:53
was um
55:54
i i just kind of left it at that for
55:57
like a week and then i saw uh
56:00
guzura
56:03
with
56:04
just like streaming apex
56:06
and again i was like what the hell
56:09
these guys are a monsters
56:12
so i was very motivated
56:14
what i did was i asked
56:16
oh it's a cringe but uh i actually
56:20
i i emailed needy sanji saying
56:23
please open a male english branch let me
56:26
in
56:28
they never replied though i i can still
56:30
remember what i actually put in
56:32
[Music]
56:34
i i can still remember
56:38
i was like i was like
56:40
open
56:41
a male
56:42
branch
56:45
i want to be a part of it i think i'm
56:48
i'd be very good for it
56:50
and
56:51
again they never got back
56:53
yeah they never got back to me
56:58
yeah they never got back to me and
57:00
i think a few months uh two months after
57:03
that they
57:04
opened auditions and
57:09
uh
57:10
yeah like i
57:13
i didn't get in
57:14
it was uh
57:18
it was laser light and
57:20
obsidia that came out of that
57:22
but hey hey i'm here right now though
57:29
i'm here right now though
57:30
[Music]
57:34
oh
57:35
for my audition process uh well
57:38
i
57:39
i really like
57:41
so when i sent mine in and i had to wait
57:43
like a very long time to actually
57:45
because um the the auditions were still
57:48
ongoing so
57:51
like
57:52
what i did was i kind of just waited and
57:55
waited and waited
57:56
until i i was actually watching
58:00
neon genesis evangelion
58:03
and i was about to fall asleep on my
58:05
couch
58:06
i was messaging a friend
58:08
on discord and a message from nidhi
58:10
sanji just like popped up
58:13
i was like before that i was probably
58:15
like uh i probably didn't get in
58:18
i was about to fall asleep like you know
58:21
and boom i saw it i saw the email i was
58:23
like oh my god
58:25
oh my god
58:26
oh my god
58:28
oh my god
58:30
email
58:31
[Music]
58:33
and and um
58:35
yeah like so i saw it
58:37
invited me to an interview
58:39
it's like oh my god oh my god oh my god
58:41
oh my god oh my god oh my god
58:43
holy
58:46
so i i took my time trying to predict
58:48
what questions they might ask me so
58:50
please if you ever get to that point do
58:52
the same thing i did because uh it'll
58:55
make it easier to answer questions you
58:56
know
58:57
um
58:58
also
58:59
yeah so uh i basically just
59:03
i tried to be confident the entire
59:06
process
59:08
then i told them about how i messaged
59:10
them
59:12
like a year ago
59:13
saying that they need a male branch
59:17
and i made them laugh a little bit

117:57
i think so um it depends if if you
118:01
if you wear like

118:08
what would you consider a perfect date
118:10
[Music]
118:12

118:14
are you asking me
118:17
it's like a whole day process okay first
118:20
of all um
118:22
you should i don't think you should ever
118:23
go to the movies
118:25
uh for your first date
118:27
guys
118:28
rent no don't ever do that
118:31
[Music]
118:33
for a first date
118:34
no
118:36
don't ever
118:40
okay
118:41
omgs kind of
118:45
because hey it's the first day you're
118:47
supposed to get to know each other not
118:48
watch the movie and eat popcorn
118:55
right
118:56
you're not gonna know them if you just
118:58
watch a movie together
119:00
oh so you watch a movie oh we're done
119:03
see you next time
119:04

yeah so you should never
119:23
i think if you go
119:25
probably like a theme park is very like
119:27
kind of generic but it works
119:31
you know
119:31
i don't think you should also take them
119:33
on
119:34
like a fancy dinner date
119:37
is uh
119:39
i i don't know
119:42
but i haven't really had any girlfriends
119:46
but
119:49
i mean i've never never had one
119:51
i've never had one okay
119:53
right don't
119:55
no one has to know
120:00
[Music]
120:03
never had one
120:04
right anyways
120:06
um what was i saying
120:08
yeah i think you should uh
120:10
you should do something fun instead of
120:12
like eating
120:13
out
120:14
or watching a movie
120:22
oh
120:24
please
120:25
okay whoops
120:27
ice skating is yeah i mean something fun
120:29
something fun would be very like
120:32
memorable
120:40
what if you do something fun first then
120:41
eat out
120:43
i mean yeah that could work too actually
120:50
if you
120:52
if you were to ask me on a date
120:54
we
120:55
i would prefer to
120:57

121:30
first date okay well make sure you guys
121:32
recommend me to them
121:35
good luck with that
121:38
i think as long as the person puts time
121:40
and effort to make that date special
121:41
then no matter what it is it'd be okay
121:51
jail date
121:53
