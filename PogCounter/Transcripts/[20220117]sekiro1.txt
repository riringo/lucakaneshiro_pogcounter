311:57
from luxian you know
312:00
first male wave
312:06
male wave
312:07
i i think you're watching the wrong
312:09
stream
312:11
best go huh
312:15
no no
312:16
not male wife what are you talking about
312:28
you always twist my words chad
312:31
you always do it
312:35
sometimes it takes a real man to become
312:37
best girl
312:44
first male wife
312:49
oh my god chad
312:51
i i just remembered
312:56
bought more chicken
312:58
i have more chicken
313:12
well this one's for my little brother
313:14
there but i forgot to give it to him
313:16
oh no
313:18
i'm so stupid i'm so stupid
313:21
all right i'll do that once i end stream
313:23
but yeah let's just talk for a bit chad
313:31
why are you eating it then because
313:32
there's 10 there's 10 there's 10 pieces
313:34
i only had six okay
313:40
i only had six
313:42
he can't wait such a nice big
313:48
he's gonna starve his brother
313:52
it's fine he he had food before i
313:55
ordered it that's what he told me it's
313:57
fine don't worry about it
314:01
you can have it for dinner you know
314:03
dinner
314:08
yeah he had food literally when i when i
314:10
ordered some ordered something
314:15
ten minus six is four
314:18
what
314:25
it's probably a little bit honestly i'd
314:27
eat it without him knowing
314:29
i i do the same i don't know i don't
314:31
really like whenever i um
314:33
order food
314:34
i don't like ordering for myself
314:37
because uh
314:39
one
314:40
delivery fee okay i want to include
314:43
people
314:45
and two
314:46
i don't know i just think it's rude it's
314:48
rude it's a little rude right
314:52
i'll i'll ask them first at least like
314:53
do you want food and you want me to
314:55
order for you
315:06
but the thing is i don't know what he
315:08
takes advantage of me
315:09
what does he want
315:10
oh i for example i want this
315:14
i want kfc for example
315:17
but i want subway
315:20
i want subway
315:26
why
315:30
i'm buying you food
315:32
choose from one
315:39
juice from one store
315:41
why do you need subway
315:45
that's like double double delivery fee
315:48
i just don't think he understands i i
315:50
don't get it i i don't get it chad
315:54
i don't understand
316:00
i swear i
316:03
both him and my older brother i i feel
316:05
like they don't really
316:10
they don't they don't have a concept of
316:15
like oh
316:17
what's the word like
316:20
they don't think about money like oh
316:22
that's a nice looking shoe i want to buy
316:24
it
316:25
oh mom give me that shoe
316:29
you just get this you get the shoe
316:32
and you don't even think about the price
316:38
you don't even think about the price
316:41
i feel like that's both of them
316:44
i don't know maybe i'm just minimalistic
316:46
i have no idea chad i i actually don't
316:49
know
316:51
am i the problem
316:55
minimalistic not materialistic
317:08
yeah like uh
317:11
like if me and my mom would go outside
317:13
and and eat like
317:15
at a restaurant yeah that's like the
317:17
first thing i think about
317:19
it's like oh
317:21
this uh rack of ribs is is 36
317:25
no i'll just order something that's like
317:27
17 instead
317:38
oh like oh she wants to buy me a shoe
317:41
i'm like no don't don't don't do it
317:44
it's like 99 bucks
317:46
please don't
317:48
i don't need it
317:53
but but when it comes to my little
317:55
brother or my older brother
317:58
they don't even think about it
318:05
they didn't even think about that
318:08
like the other day my older brother went
318:10
up to me and was like hey
318:13
um oh what was it what's the [ __ ] he was
318:16
he was trying to buy a game i think
318:17
that's what he was trying to do
318:19
far cry 6 i think he was trying by it's
318:22
like oh can you buy it for me
318:26
it's just 100 bucks i'm like
318:28
it's a hundred bucks
318:34
it's it's a hundred
318:41
you work too why are you asking me for
318:44
money you know
318:50
yeah i think it was like far cry 6. he
318:51
was trying to buy [ __ ] he wants me to
318:53
pay for it
318:55
i don't know why
318:57
but he he literally earns money
319:00
probably a lot
319:03
he he won't i i don't know where he
319:05
works but
319:07
i know he earns a lot
319:08
but he still wants me to pay for it
319:11
why
319:22
do you get gifts from him though
319:24
uh
319:26
like he does um
319:28
he does go up to me
319:30
when it's like my birthday
319:33
he'll go up to me and ask me if there's
319:34
anything i want i usually just i don't
319:36

360:22
i don't know
360:28
well
360:29
i have a 30 70 because when it came out
360:32
people actually thought that
360:35
it's gonna cost a lot of money but
360:37
i mean it costed 500 bucks which is
360:39
still a lot by the way
360:41
but for graphics cards
360:44
when you compare it to how much it's
360:45
worth right now
360:46
it's
360:48
very cheap
360:52
i got it at the lowest price possible
361:03
a person's heartbeat can't be that high
361:05

362:19
um
362:21
i i sometimes do
362:23
that that's mainly because like
362:26
it's kind of like feedback for me one is
362:28
the mic
362:30
quality fine
362:32
two is the game sound okay
362:35
you know i gotta find like that right
362:38
spot
362:39
on obs where the music should be like
362:42
maxing out at
362:44
uh to
362:46
just basically how how i sound and how i
362:49
speak
362:50
it's kind of like feedback for me i
362:52
don't really want i don't do it all the
362:53
time
362:55
but if there's like a fun funny moment
362:59
in a stream
363:01
that i did or someone else's yeah oh
363:03
i'll rewatch it
363:05
i think it's good yeah
363:07

363:11
that way you can really
363:13
you can kind of figure out what you need
363:14

364:14
steps you can take like
364:18

364:21
are you interacting with chad a lot
364:23
