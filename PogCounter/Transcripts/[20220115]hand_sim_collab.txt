it was a nine-year-old kid
201:39
uh
201:40
so we were like the i was the youngest
201:42
one but there was also a young one who
201:44
which was uh nine years old
201:46
uh my my brother's friends were a little
201:48
bit older
201:50
but but
201:52
we were out
201:56
my i think i think my mom actually
201:58
gave us permission to go out
202:00
and and go to the park
202:03
and light up fireworks because it was
202:04
new years
202:07

202:12
yeah it was it was new years
202:15
so
202:17

my my my brother's friends had the idea
202:22
to put me
202:23
like to circle
202:25
to make up to make a circle
202:27
with me in it
202:29

203:38
core memory like it's right there with

205:41
luca thank you for the love and loves
205:43
for this especially after a long week in
205:45
the hospital how scary are the animal in
205:47
australia
205:49
and scariest encounter with wildlife
205:51
wildlife
205:53
kissing cuddles thank you
205:58
hmm
206:01
okay
206:05
the thing is
206:06
when people say australia is scary
206:09
it really isn't i i don't
206:12
it really isn't
206:14
when you see like a very deadly snake
206:17
if you see a very deadly spider
206:20
if you see
206:23
you don't see that every day you don't
206:25
you just don't
206:32
[Music]
206:35
you don't ever see that if you're in a
206:37
city
206:38
you don't see a kangaroo if you're in a
206:41
city
206:43
[Music]
206:47
you don't see a koala if you're in the
206:48
city you don't see an emu if you're in
206:50
the city
206:52
you said spider
206:53
well
206:56
well it depends on how it depends on how
206:59
that depends on the state of your house
207:01
okay if you're not taking care of your
207:02
house yes you will have spiders yes you
207:04
will you will
207:18
yes you will you will have you will have
207:21
spiders unfortunately
207:22
if you don't actually clean
207:26
do you regularly have bug spray
207:28
no
207:29
because uh
207:31
the bugs you see most of the time are
207:33
moths and i i'm pretty scared of moths
207:35
too
207:40
do you wash your house
207:43
how huge are those spiders by the way ah
207:46
the one that was in my room during the
207:48
way out collab was
207:51
like half a phone big
207:53
it was big
207:58
you don't strike me as a person that
208:00
cleans their house really really
208:02
that's very surprising because i
208:04

240:15
how do you get past the stupid path with
240:18
the stupid-ass lamps
240:21
oh the lamps um
240:22
so
240:23
you could graze on the walls
240:26
so like the the walls have a lot of grip
240:29
so you you could utilize that pretty
240:31
well can't even get into the path that's
240:33
the problem
240:35
oh then
240:37
just climb forehead
240:39
yo
240:42
is that any way to talk to your senpai
240:46

241:03
[Music]
241:06
i thought you wanted help
241:08
oh no anyone can help me oh petra on the
241:11
walls there's actually a lot of grip so
241:13
if you graze your little hammer on it
241:16
you can be
241:17
[Music]
241:24
and if you want to get into the pathway
241:26
you can just do like a little hopper
241:27
this part's also very
241:30
hard man see why can't you be more like
241:33
a lira issue
241:39
i'll try i'll try
241:42
i'll try a lot yeah lyra sounds nice
241:44

241:47
i'm nice to you
241:49
we're getting an hour head start in a
241:51
race
241:53
no i didn't get an hour head start i
241:54
started on time
241:55
[Laughter]
241:57
i started the stream but it was supposed
241:59
to start
242:01
i don't know if that's a head start i
242:03
actually waited until
242:05
i actually waited 15 minutes after the
242:07
hour
242:10
i slept we can leave the teacher doesn't
242:13
come in 15 minutes we can leave and i
242:15
was like you're right guys so i sat and
242:17
talked for 15 minutes and she still
242:19
didn't mess up i shouldn't even message
242:20
me until like
242:23
like 35 minutes after the hour
242:27
cause i thought it was starting later
242:30
