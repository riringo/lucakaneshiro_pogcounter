uh you haven't missed anything we're
15:13
just starting now
15:17
we get ready chad
15:20
as
15:22
especially when it's something that
15:24
doesn't grab your attention like
15:25
literature
15:34
oh honey uh hi boss i'm growing i'm a
15:37
growing artist but your debut has
15:38
inspired me so much you heard to grow as
15:40
an artist alongside your career draw
15:41
nice lucas thank you honey
15:44
thank you
15:46
good job good ah no no good job uh
15:50
oh what's the word ah
15:58
hold on
16:01
no not good luck
16:04
uh
16:05
you got this
16:07
oh my god
16:08
[Music]
16:16
[Laughter]
16:23
okay
16:26
you have to work hard to convince people
16:28
that you're both fun and worthwhile
16:33
but it makes school events like the
16:35
festival much that much more important
16:39
i'm confident that we can all really
16:41
grow this club before we graduate
16:43
right natsuki
16:49
oh god
16:52
well
16:53
well
16:54
well
16:55
god damn you natsuki why are you like
16:57
this
17:00
well
17:02
i i guess
17:07
oh not
17:09
okay chad let me just
17:11
natsuki reluctantly agrees
17:15
such different girls all interested in
17:17
the same goal
17:18
monica must have worked really hard just
17:20
to find these two
17:23
yuri returns to the table carrying a tea
17:25
set
17:26
she carefully places the teacup in front
17:27
of each of us before setting down a
17:29
teapot in the middle
17:34
you keep a whole tea set in the
17:35
classroom
17:37
don't worry
17:39
don't don't worry
17:40
the teachers gave us permission
17:43
after all
17:44
but that's
17:45
doesn't a hot cup of tea help you enjoy
17:47
a good book okay how is it how is it so
17:49
far chat is it good
17:53
uh
17:54
uh i guess
17:57
don't let yourself get intimidated
17:59
yuri's just trying to impress you
18:02
that's not
18:04
insulted yuri looks away
18:07
i meant that you know
18:10
i believe you
18:11
well tian reading might not be a pastime
18:14
for me but i at least enjoy tea
18:16
i'm glad
18:19
yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief
18:22
so
18:23
luca
18:24
what kinds of things do you like to read
18:27
well
18:28
[Music]
18:30
considering how little i've read the
18:32
past few years i don't really have a
18:35
good way of answering that
18:40
manga i bought it quietly to myself half
18:43
jerking
18:46
oh [ __ ]
18:47
natsuki's head suddenly perks up
18:50
looks like she wants to say something
18:51
but she keeps quiet
18:54
not much of a reader i guess
18:56
dad it's the same exact thing we did
18:58
this before
19:08
it's the exact same thing
19:14
well that that can change
19:18
what am i saying
19:21
i spoke without thinking after seeing
19:22
yuri's sad smile
19:26
anyway
19:28
what about you yuri
19:30
well let's see
19:32
he retraces the room
19:34
i i
19:36
i can imagine that chat
19:38
i'm doing it right now
19:43
yuri traces the rim of her teacup with
19:45
her fingers
19:47
i lip eye
19:50
how's
19:56
[Music]
20:04
[Music]
20:05
my favorites are usually novels that be
20:07
that build deep and complex fantasy
20:10
worlds
20:11
the level of creativity and
20:13
craftsmanships behind them is amazing to
20:15
me
20:16
and telling a good historians to foreign
20:18
world is equally impressive i lip eye
20:22
yuri goes on clearly passionate about
20:25
her reading
20:26
she seems so reserved and timid since
20:28
the moment i walked in
20:30
but it's obvious by the way her eyes
20:32
light up that she finds her comfort in
20:33
the world of books not people
20:37
but you know
20:38
i like a lot of things
20:40
stories with deep psychological elements
20:42
usually immerse me well
20:45
isn't it amazing how a writer can
20:46
deliberately taken
20:49
take advantage of your own lack of
20:51
imagination to completely throw you off
20:53
the loop
20:56
hello all new hello all new viewers make
20:58
sure to read the pin and watch without
21:01
caution yes
21:03
anyway
21:04
god my voice
21:11
anyway uh i i've been reading a lot of
21:14
horror recently
21:16
ah
21:17
i read a horror book once
21:21
i desperately grasp something i can
21:22
relate to
21:24
at the minimal level
21:25
at this rate yuri might as well be
21:28
having a conversation with a rock
21:31
i'd expect that from you yuri
21:34
it suits you person it's just your
21:36
personality
21:38
oh is that so
21:40
really if a story makes me think or
21:42
takes me to another world
21:44
then i really can't put it down
21:47
surreal horror is often very successful
21:49
at changing the way you look at the
21:50
world
21:53
if only for a brief moment
21:56
oh i hate horror
21:59
oh
21:59
i said
22:02
congratulations one million herbert dog
22:04
thank you
22:05
we did reach 1 million wow
22:13
well i just
22:18
natsuki's eyes dot over to me for a
22:20
split second she's looking at me
22:23
oh god
22:31
never mind
22:32
[Music]
22:34
that's right you usually like to write
22:36
about cute things don't you datsuki
22:40
what what
22:42
what gives you that idea
22:44
you'll have a piece of scrap paper
22:45
behind the last club meeting
22:48
it looked like you were working on a
22:49
pump called
22:51
don't see it
22:53
get out loud
22:55
fine fine
22:57
natsuki you write your own poems
22:59
uh well
23:00
i i guess sometimes
23:02
why do you care
23:05
i think that's impressive
23:07
why don't you share them sometime
23:09
no
23:11
natsuki advertise
23:13
oh hi
23:20
you wouldn't like them
23:22
ah not a very confident writer yet
23:25
i understand how natsuki feels
23:28
sharing that level of writing takes more
23:30
than just confidence
23:31
the truest form of writing is writing to
23:33
oneself
23:35
you must be willing to open up to your
23:37
readers exposing your fun
23:41
vulnerabilities and showing even the
23:43
deepest reaches of your heart
23:46
don't you have writing experience too
23:48
yuri
23:51
oh my god
23:53
wow
23:56
i should have prepared i should have
23:57
prepared for this more today
24:03
maybe if you share some of your work you
24:04
can settle and help natsuki and feel
24:06
comfortable with sharing hers
24:08
[Music]
24:10
i guess it's the same for yuri
24:14
we all sit in silence for a moment
24:19
hey
24:20
i got an idea
24:22
how about this
24:23
huh
24:26
natsuki and yuri look quizzically at
24:28
monica how are you fina
24:33
let's all go home and write a poem of
24:34
our own
24:36
and next time we mean
24:38
we'll all share them with each other
24:41
that way everyone is even
24:44
[Music]
24:49
i mean i thought it was a good idea
24:52
well
24:53
i think you're right monica
24:55
we should probably start finding
24:56
activities
24:59
for all of us to participate together
25:02
i did decide to take the responsibility
25:03
of vice president after all
25:06
i need to do my best to nurture the club
25:08
as well as its members
25:10
besides
25:13
now that we have a new member
25:15
it seems like it's a good step for us to
25:18
take
25:19
do you agree as well luka hold on
25:21
there's still one problem
25:25
what's
25:26
that now that we've reached the most
25:29
important topic i bluntly come forward
25:32
with what's been on my mind the entire
25:34
time
25:36
i never said i would join this club
25:39
monica may have convinced me to stop by
25:41
but i never made a decision
25:43
i still have other clubs to look at it
25:45
uh
25:49
i lose my train of thought
25:51
all three girls stand back at me with
25:52
ejected eyes
25:55
what
25:56
i'm sorry
25:58
i thought
26:07
the girls exchanged glasses before
26:09
monica turns back to me
26:12
i guess
26:13
i need to tell you the truth luca
26:16
nothing is
26:18
you don't have enough peppers you had to
26:20
form
26:21
an official club
26:26
oh we need four
26:28
and i've been trying to really
26:30
really hard to find new members
26:33
and if you don't find one more before
26:34
the festival
26:37
i
26:39
i'm defenseless against these girls
26:41
don't sip again
26:43
stop
26:47
how am i supposed to make a clear-headed
26:49
decision when it's like this
26:53
i would feel terrible for letting
26:54
everyone down in this situation and
26:56
besides the club itself seems pretty
26:58
relaxed so if writing poems is the price
27:01
i need to pay in order to spend my every
27:02
day with these with these
27:04
beautiful girls girl girl
27:10
right
27:12

27:14

it
35:12

35:32
wait can you guys not hear it
35:40
is it too quiet
35:47
oh come on like he deserves any slack
35:51
he already had to be dragged here by
35:53
monica
35:54
i don't even i don't know if you're
35:55
planning just to come here to hang out
35:57
or what
35:58
but if you don't take a serious thing
36:00
then you won't see the end of it
36:03
i can't read
36:08
big mouth big mouth for someone who
36:10
keeps her manga collection in her room
36:14
[Music]
36:15
oski finds herself stuck between saying
36:17
monica and manga
36:20
manga is literature
36:26
swiftly defeated natsuki plops back into
36:29
a seat
36:31
i i'm sorry luca
36:33
we'll make sure to put your comfort
36:35
first
36:36
okay
36:38
yuri shoots natsuki with a disappointed
36:40
uh disappointed glance
36:42
um anyway
36:44
now that you're in a club and all
36:45
perhaps you might have you might have
36:47
interest in picking up a
36:49
book to read
36:52
well
36:53
i can't really so
36:55
so i'm just reading chat at the same
36:57
time what's going on
36:58
the verb oh the
37:05
yeah it's tilted
37:10
is it zooming in
37:16
that's kind of saucy
37:20
uh i can't really say no either way
37:23
like you said i'm in this club now
37:25
so it only feels right for me to do
37:27
something like that if you ask
37:29
what wait
37:31
i didn't mean like that
37:35
if you don't really want to then forget
37:37
i said anything i guess
37:39
no it's not that yuri
37:41
i
37:42
want to be
37:44
i want to try to be a part of this club
37:47
so even if i don't read often i'd be
37:49
happy to pick up a book
37:50
even if you
37:51
if you wanted me to
37:55
are you sure
37:57
it just felt like
37:59
well
38:00
as vice president and all
38:03
that i should help you get started in
38:05
something you might like
38:08
you regret you reaches into her bag and
38:10
pulls out a book
38:14
let me just put this there
38:16
i didn't want you to feel left out
38:19
so i picked out a book that i thought
38:21
you might enjoy
38:22
it's a short read
38:24
so
38:25
you should keep your attention even if
38:27
you don't usually read
38:29
and we could you know
38:32
discuss it if you wanted
38:36
this is
38:39
how is this girl accidentally being so
38:42
cute
38:44
she even picked out a book she thinks i
38:46
like
38:47
despite me not reading much
38:53
yuri thank you
38:54
i'll
38:55
definitely read this
38:57
i enthusiastically take the book
39:01
i need a book chat i need a book
39:07
i enthusiastically take the book
39:10
thank you
39:15
well
39:16
you can read it at your own pace
39:19
but i look forward to hearing what you
39:20
think
39:23
now that everyone settled in i expected
39:25
monica to kick off some scheduled
39:27
activities for the club
39:29
but that doesn't seem to be the case
39:31
kiri's face is already
39:33
buried in a book
39:35
i can't help but notice her intense
39:37
expression like she was waiting for this
39:38
chance
39:41
meanwhile natsuki's rummaging around in
39:44
a closet
39:48
i'm
39:50
really curious to talk to yuri a little
39:51
bit more
39:53
at the same time i would feel bad for
39:55
distracting her from reading
39:58
i catch a glimpse of the cover of the
40:00
book
40:05
oh what is that
40:08
oh it looks like the same book that she
40:10
lent me
40:11
oh pog more than that she seems to be on
40:13
the very first few pages look at hitting
40:15
on yuri cat cake happy new year's eve
40:17

40:20

40:21

40:39
[Music]
40:48
crap
40:49
[Music]
40:50
i think she noticed me looking at her
40:54
she sneaked some of the glass at me and
40:57
her eyes met for a split second
41:02
but that only makes her hide her face
41:04
deeper in her book
41:10
sorry
41:11
i was just spacing out
41:13
i wanted this sentencing i made her
41:15
uncomfortable
41:18
oh it's fine
41:21
i was focused then if i was focused then
41:25
i probably wouldn't have nervous in the
41:26
first place
41:28
but i'm just rereading a bit of this so
41:32
that's the book you gave me right
41:35
uh-huh
41:36
i just wanted to read some of it
41:38
not for any particular reason
41:40
[Music]
41:42
just curious how come you have two
41:43
copies of the same book
41:46
uh well
41:48
well
41:48
i stopped at the bookstore yesterday
41:51
and oh that's not what i meant
41:54
i mean
41:55
i just happened to buy two of them
41:58
ah i see
42:00
there's some something fairly obvious
42:03
here that yuri isn't telling me
42:05
but decide to let it but i decided to
42:07
let it go
42:09
i'll definitely start reading it soon
42:12
i'm glad to hear
42:14
once it starts to pick up
42:17
might have a hard time putting it down
42:19
it's a very engaging and relatable story
42:23
is that so
42:24
what's the story about anyway her eyes
42:27
eye lip eye did you see that
42:29
no
42:30
[Music]
42:32
it's fine
42:35
you guys mean
42:36
[Music]
42:38
i lip eye i lip i what
42:43
what's the story about anyway
42:46
well
42:48
and look at the cover of the book the
42:50
book is titled
42:51
portrait of markov
42:55
[Music]
42:56
there's an ominous looking eye symbol on
42:58
the front cover
43:00
basically it's about this religious camp
43:02
that was turned into a human experiment
43:03
prison
43:05
and
43:06
the people trapped there have this trait
43:07
that turns them into killing machines
43:08
that lust for blood
43:11
but the facility gets even worse and
43:13
they start selectively breeding people
43:15
wait what the hell it's kind of weird
43:18
they're cutting off their limbs and
43:19
fixing to them too what
43:21
[Music]
43:23
uh oh
43:24
that might be a little bit of a spoiler
43:27
but anyway i'm really into it
43:30
[Music]
43:32
but the book i mean
43:34
not the thing about the limbs
43:37
that's kind
43:38
of it's kind of dark isn't it
43:42
yuri made it sound like it was going to
43:44
be a such a nice story so that dark turn
43:46
came back came from out of nowhere
43:49
i lip eye
43:52
uh are you not a fan of that sort of
43:54
thing luka
43:56
no it's not that
43:58
i
43:59
mean
44:00
hold on i think the music is a little
44:02
too loud
44:03
i mean i can definitely enjoy these
44:05
those kind of stories so don't worry i
44:08
hope so
44:09
yeah
44:10
i
44:11
totally forgot what yuri that yuri is
44:13
into
44:14
a yuri is into those things why can't i
44:16
read today
44:19
she's so shy and reclusive on the
44:20
outside but her mind seems to be
44:22
completely different
44:24
it's just that this kind of story
44:27
it's it kind of challenges you to look
44:29
at life from a strange new perspective
44:32
when horrible things happen not just
44:34
because someone wants to be evil
44:36
[Music]
44:41
i don't know this
44:43
[Music]
44:45
that's a little strange
44:47
um
44:50
[Music]
44:51
but because the world is full of
44:53
horrible people and we're all worthless
44:56
anyway
45:01
i'm rambling aren't i
45:06
i'm sorry
45:09
hey uh don't apologize
45:13
i haven't lost interest or anything
45:14
[Music]
45:17
well
45:18
i guess it's all right then
45:20
but i feel like i should let you know
45:21
that i have this problem
45:23
but i let things like books and writing
45:25
fill my thoughts
45:26
[Music]
45:28
it's too fast i can't read
45:31
i kind of forgot
45:33
[Music]
45:35
to pay attention to other people
45:37
so i'm sorry if i end up saying
45:39
something strange
45:41
and please stop me if i start talking
45:43
too much
45:45
that's
45:48
i really don't think you need to worry
45:50
i almost forgot it's simping hours oh
45:52
thank you
45:53
[Music]
45:55

46:12

46:24

46:27

next to yuri's
46:56
[Music]
47:01
are you sure
47:02
you seem a little apprehensive
47:05
that's
47:07
i'm sorry
47:09
it's not that i don't want you to
47:11
it's just something i'm not very used to
47:14
that is
47:16
creating an accompany with someone
47:19
i see
47:20
well just tell me if i end up
47:22
distracting you or anything
47:24
all right
47:26
i open up the book it's not the prologue
47:29
[Music]
47:30
as soon as i understand what yuri means
47:32
chad it's the same exact thing
47:51
[Music]
47:53
it's literally the same text
47:57
okay
47:57
[Music]
47:59
it's as if i can feel her presence over
48:01
my shoulder as i read
48:04
it's not part a particularly bad thing
48:08
maybe a little distracting but the
48:11
feeling is somewhat comforting
48:13
are you late no no you're not
48:16
yuri is in the corner of my eye
48:20
i can see her
48:23
i realize that she's not actually
48:25
looking at her own book
48:27
i glance over
48:29
it looks like she's reading from my book
48:31
instead
48:34
sorry
48:37
you guys are telling me to open the
48:38
history
48:40
[Music]
48:42

[Music]
48:48
yeah what are you guys on
48:50
[Music]
48:53
you're you really you really apologize a
48:55
lot don't you
48:58
i do
49:00
i don't really mean to
49:03
sorry
49:05
i mean
49:06
[Laughter]
49:08
here this should work right
49:11
i slide my task until it's up again
49:13
series then hold my book
49:16
or between the two of them
49:19
oh
49:21
i suppose so
49:24
yuri timidly closes her own copy
49:28
once we each lean in a bit
49:30
my shoulders are almost touching
49:34
it feels like my left arm is in the way
49:36
so
49:38
instead i use my right hand to hold the
49:40
book open
49:43
i guess
49:45
that makes it kind of difficult to turn
49:46
the page
49:48
here
49:50
[Music]
49:51
chat legendary read scene
49:55
[Music]
49:58
yuri takes her left arm and holds the
50:00
left side of the book between her thumb
50:02
and forefinger
50:04
[Music]
50:06
whoa she looks pretty
50:08
someone says
50:10
[Music]
50:13
ah
50:14
i do the same with my right arm on the
50:16
right side of my book
50:18
that way i turn a page and yuri slides
50:20
it
50:21
under her thumb
50:22
after it flips to her side
50:25
but in holding it like this
50:27
we're huddled even closer together
50:29
together than before
50:31
it's
50:32
actually kind of
50:34
distracting me
50:36
[Music]
50:38
it's as if i can feel the warmth of
50:40
yuri's face as she's in the corner of my
50:42
vision
50:45
are you ready
50:47
[Music]
50:51
to turn the page oh she's looking
50:55
[Music]
50:56
uh sorry
50:58
i think i got a bit distracted for a
51:01
second
51:02
i glanced over yuri's face again and our
51:03
eyes met
51:04
meat
51:06
i don't know how i'll be able to keep up
51:08
with her
51:10
ah
51:11
that's okay
51:12
[Music]
51:14
you're not as used to reading right
51:16
i don't mind being patient if it takes
51:18
you a little bit longer
51:19
it's probably the least i can do
51:25
did you be patient with me yeah
51:28
thanks
51:30
we continue reading
51:32
yuri no longer asks me if i'm ready to
51:34
turn the page instead
51:36
i just assume that she finishes the page
51:38
before me so i turn it by my own
51:40
volition
51:42
we continue the first chapter in silence
51:45
even so turning each page almost feels
51:47
like an intimate exchange what the [ __ ]
51:51
my my thumb gently letting letting go of
51:54
the page
51:55
letting it flutter over to her side as
51:57
she catches it under her thumb
52:01
[Music]
52:02
yuri
52:08
[Music]
52:10
this might be a silly thought but
52:12
the main character kind of reminds me of
52:15
you a little bit
52:19
no
52:21
i don't relate to this character at all
52:24
definitely not
52:25
[Music]
52:26
really
52:29
i was just thinking the way she second
52:32
guesses the things she says and all that
52:34
[Music]
52:37
that's what you were talking about
52:40
sorry
52:41
[Music]
52:42
i thought you meant something
52:44
else about her
52:45
something else
52:46
it's never right
52:48
we didn't get we didn't even get that
52:50
far yet
52:51
so i don't know why that came into my
52:53
head
52:56
yuri are you feeling all right
52:58
huh
53:01
yuri's been a little fidgety ever since
53:03
we started reading
53:06
you can rest if you're feeling sick or
53:07
something
53:08
your breathing's a little
53:11
my breathing

54:06

54:14
morning voice

56:35
luca
56:36
did something happen just now
56:40
huh
56:42
i have no idea
56:45
yuri was acting a little strange i guess
56:47
[Music]
56:48
so you don't know anything
56:51
sorry i can't say i do
56:54
are you worried about her
56:55
oh no not really
56:58
i was just making sure that you didn't
57:00
do anything to her
57:02
no nothing
57:05
don't worry i believe you silly
57:08
silly
57:09

57:14
[Music]
57:17

57:19
nothing alarming
57:22
he's sassy
57:23
[Music]
57:25
all right if you say sir
57:28
anyway why don't we start with sharing
57:30
our poems with each other
57:32
huh
57:33
should we wait for yuri
57:35
well she might be for she might be a
57:36
while so i figured we'd get started
57:39
without her
57:40
[Music]
57:42
oh my god you're so cute i really like
57:44
you if you have a good day thank you
57:45
viceland
57:46
is that okay
57:47
yeah i was just asking
57:50
stand up
57:51
i make a mental note of where i left off
57:53
in the book then i slip it back into my
57:54
bag
57:58
who should i show my poem first natsuki
58:00
come on
58:01
[Applause]
58:04
it's probably only fair i shared mine
58:06
with her first
58:12
well
58:13
it's
58:14
about what i expect you can eat
58:15
something like you
58:18
that's a little blunt
58:21
well excuse me
58:25
it's not like i said it was bad
58:28
it just didn't evoke any emotions
58:31
so basically it's not cute enough for
58:34
your tastes
58:37
you want to get smacked
58:41
oh
58:42
pass
58:44
okay i will pass
58:48
well
58:49
anyways i guess i need to show you mine
58:52
[Music]
58:56
i thought you'd like it
58:59
oh no it's the same one
59:01
it's the same one
59:05
eagles can fly
59:08
monkeys can climb crickets can leap
59:12
horses can race
59:14
owls can seek
59:16
cheetahs can run
59:18
eagles can fly
59:20
people
59:21
can try
59:23
but that's about it that's about it
59:27
nice
59:29
we got it
59:34
yeah
59:35
i told you you weren't gonna like it
59:38
uh i like it
59:40
what
59:42
just be honest
59:44
i am
59:47
why is a convinced that i wouldn't like
59:48
it
59:50
wow
59:51
because
59:53
everyone in high school thinks that
59:54
writing has to be all sophisticated and
59:56
stuff
59:58
some people don't even take my writing
60:00
seriously
60:01
but isn't the point of writing
60:03
poems uh for people to express
60:05
themselves
60:07
you're writing
60:08
your writing style wouldn't make your
60:10
message any less valid
60:12
yes exactly
60:15
i like it when it's easy to read but
60:17
it's hard
60:19
like in this poem
60:23
seeing everyone around you do great
60:25
things can be really disheartening
60:28
god why is your voice so high
60:32
so i decided to write about it
60:36
yeah i understand
60:38
but
60:39
the other nice thing about simple
60:41
writing is that it puts more weight in
60:43
the workplace
60:44
[Music]
60:46
like i set up for a rhyme at the end
60:50
but then made it fall flat on purpose
60:54
it helps bring out the feeling in the
60:55
last line
60:57
so you did
61:00
i guess more went into it than i
61:02
realized
61:04
that's what it means to be a pro
61:08
i'm glad you learned something
61:10
[Music]
61:12
did you expect that from the youngest
61:13
one here did you
61:15
yeah guess not
61:18
i decided you and her with the last
61:19
comment
61:21
uh i don't really care how old everyone
61:23
is but if natsuki is feeling proud then
61:25
i won't take that away from her
61:31
monika
61:34
hi luca
61:35
having a good time so far
61:38
uh yeah
61:40
good glad to hear it
61:42
by the way since you're new and
61:44
everything
61:45
if you ever have any suggestions for the
61:47
club like new activities or things like
61:49
that we can do better i'm always
61:52
listening
61:56
don't be afraid to bring things up okay
61:59
all right i'll keep that to mind
62:02
of course
62:03
i'll be afraid to bring things up
62:05
i'm much better off just going with the
62:06
floor until i'm more settled in
62:09
anyway
62:12
i want to share your power with me
62:15
it's kind of embarrassing but i guess i
62:17
have to
62:21
don't worry luca
62:22
we're all a little embarrassed today you
62:24
know
62:25
but it's
62:26
that sort of barrier that we'll all
62:28
learn to get past soon
62:30
yeah that's true
62:32
i had monica
62:34
my poem
62:36
[Music]
62:39
great job luca
62:40
i was going oh
62:42
in my head while reading it
62:45
it's really metaphorical
62:48
i'm not sure why but
62:50
i didn't expect you to go for something
62:52
so deep
62:53
i guess i really underestimated you
62:56
it's easiest for me to keep
62:58
everyone's expectations learned
63:02
that way it always counts when i put in
63:04
some effort
63:06
that's not very fair
63:08
i guess it worked anyway
63:11
you know that yuri likes this kind of
63:12
writing right
63:14
writing that's full of imagery and
63:16
symbolism
63:17
sometimes i feel like yuri's mind is
63:19
totally detached from reality
63:22
i don't mean that like it's a bad thing
63:24
though
63:26
okay could you
63:28
you could voice a female character and i
63:30
wouldn't even notice she was a voiced by
63:32
a man
63:34
oh
63:35
thank you i guess
63:39
[Music]
63:44
spent so much time in her own head that
63:46
it probably it's probably a much more
63:48
interesting place for her
63:52
but that's why she gets so happy when
63:54
you treat her with a lot of kindness
63:56
i don't think she's used to being in
63:57
touch like that
63:59
she must be really starved for social
64:01
interaction so i don't blame her for
64:02
coming on a little strongly
64:05
like earlier
64:07
i think if she gets too stimulated she
64:09
ends up withdrawal and looking for a
64:11
long time
64:13
suddenly the door opens
64:17
yuri
64:19
i'm back
64:21
did i miss anything
64:23
not really
64:25
oh well
64:26
we all started sharing our poems with
64:27
each other
64:30
uh i'm forgetting monica i'm forgetting
64:32
monika
64:33
monica's more like sayori but a little
64:35
deeper right
64:39
[Music]
64:40
uh
64:41
already
64:43
i'm sorry for being late
64:45
no need to apologize
64:47
we still have plenty of time so i'm
64:49
more glad that y'all that you took all
64:52
the time you needed
64:55
all right
64:56
thanks monica
64:58
i suppose i should get my poem now
65:01
anyway
65:02
do you want to read my palm now
65:04
sorry i'm not very good
65:06
[Music]
65:07
pretty confident for someone who claims
65:09
to be not very good
65:11
well that's because i have sound
65:13
confidence
65:14
doesn't mean i always feel that way you
65:16
know
65:17
i see
65:18
well let's read it then who's sayori oh
65:24
hole in the wall
65:25
but he wasn't looking at me
65:29
i frankly
65:30
i frantically glanced at my surroundings
65:33
but my burned eyes could no longer see
65:36
color
65:38
are there other other uh are there are
65:41
there others
65:43
in this room
65:44
are they talking
65:46
or are they
65:47
but i can't do this american accent at
65:49
all
65:52
i can't do it at all
65:55
where are they
65:56
are they simply poems on flat sheets of
65:58
paper
65:59
the sounds of frantic
66:05
it sounds frantic's crawling playing
66:08
tricks in my ears
66:10
the room begins to crinkle closing in on
66:13
me the air i breathe dissipates before
66:16
it reaches my lungs i panic there must
66:19
be a way out
66:20
it's right there
66:22
it's right there
66:24
swallowing my fears i practice my pet
66:28
pet pet
66:30
head
66:33
[Music]
66:36
so what do you think
66:39
it's very free form if that's what you
66:41
call it
66:44
sorry i'm not the right person to ask
66:46
for feedback
66:48
it's okay
66:49
yeah that kind of style has gone pretty
66:51
popular nowadays
66:53
that is a lot of poems have been putting
66:55
emphasis on the timing between words and
66:57
lines
66:58
when performed out loud it could be
67:00
really powerful
67:02
so what was the inspiration behind this
67:04
one
67:05
uh
67:06
well i'm not sure if i know how to put
67:08
it
67:10
i guess you could say that i
67:12
had some kind of epiphany
67:15
recently
67:18
it's been influencing my palms a bit
67:21
an epiphany
67:23
yeah
67:24
something like that
67:26
i'm kind of nervous to talk about deep
67:28
stuff like that because it's coming on
67:30
strongly
67:32
maybe after everyone's better friends
67:33
with each other
67:35
anyway
67:36
here's monica's writing tip of the day
67:40
sometimes when you're right
67:44
[Music]
67:45
out of out of the three so far she's so
67:48
hard
67:49
like to do
67:52
[Music]
67:54
sometimes when you're writing a poem a
67:56
story your brain gets too fixated on on
67:59
a specific point
68:00
[Music]
68:02
if you try so hard to make it perfect
68:04
then you'll never make any progress
68:06
just force yourself to get something
68:08
done paint on paper and slightly
68:12
and tidy up later [ __ ]
68:17
[Music]
68:20
deep voice monika no
68:22
another way to think about it is this
68:25
if you keep your pen in the same spot
68:27
for too long you'll just get you'll just
68:29
get a big dark puddle of ink
68:32
so just move your hand
68:34
and go with the flow
68:36
that's my advice for today
68:38
is that actually true chat if you just
68:40
if you just like hold a pen oh
68:46
[Music]
68:56
oh my my pinky
69:00
[Music]
69:06
my pinky
69:09
i hit it on my desk it hurts what
69:18
[ __ ]
69:23
i'm sorry chad
69:26
oh my god
69:31
you know how you
69:32
like have you ever hit your knuckles
69:36

69:45

69:48

70:33
as yuri reads the poem wrong [ __ ] up to
70:36
you
70:36
i noticed her eyes gliding
70:39
exceptional
70:41
huh what was that
70:44
did i say that out loud
70:47
yuri first covers her mouth and then
70:49
ends up covering her face
70:56
[Music]
70:59
he's going to hate me
71:01
um
71:03
you really didn't do anything wrong yuri
71:06
pets
71:08
i guess you're right
71:10
what am i getting nervous for
71:13
yuri takes a breath
71:17
so
71:18
what kind of writing experience do you
71:20
have
71:21
[Music]
71:23
your use of imagery and metaphors
71:26
indicates you've written a lot of poetry
71:28
before
71:29
really
71:30
wow wow that's a huge compliment coming
71:33
from you
71:34
this is actually my first time really
71:37
huh
71:39
yuri stands at me blankly then looks at
71:41
my poem again
71:44
well i know that
71:46
i just spent
71:48
yuri trails off unable to find an excuse
71:51
she traces
71:52
she traces her fingers along the words
71:55
in her poem as if breaking it down more
71:58
thoroughly
72:00
yeah
72:01
okay
72:02
this is the reason i was able to tell
72:05
it's just that there are specific
72:07
writing habits that are usually typical
72:09
of new writers
72:10
and having
72:12
been through them myself i kind of
72:14
learned to pick up on them
72:16
i think the most noticeable thing i
72:18
recognize in new writers is that they
72:20
try to make their style very deliberate
72:23
in other words they tend to pick up
72:25
writing styles separate from the topic
72:26
matter
72:27
and
72:28
they form fit the two together
72:31
what the hell is she talking
72:34
about the end result is both the style
72:38
and the expressiveness are weakened
72:42
once yuri finds her train of thought it
72:44
tends to have her demeanor to it totally
72:46
changes
72:48
[Music]
72:50
her stammering is completely gone
72:53
as she sounds like an expert
72:55
of course
72:57
that's not something you can be playing
72:59
for
73:00
there are so many different skills and
73:01
techniques that go into writing a simple
73:03
form
73:05
not just finding them
73:10
oh
73:12
yeah it's the fact that i've read this
73:14
before
73:15
it's just so hard to like read through
73:17
it again
73:22
i also hope that everyone in the club
73:24
gives you valuable feedback
73:26
natsuki can be a little pious can be a
73:28
little bit biased though
73:32
hell
73:34
um
73:35
well
73:36
never mind
73:37
i shouldn't be talking about people like
73:39
that
73:40
sorry
73:42
it's fine
73:45
i'm not sure if yuri is apologizing
73:47
apologizing to herself or natsuki
73:50
do you mind do you mind if i read your
73:52
poem now
73:53
please do
73:55
i'd love to share my thought process
73:56
behind it
73:57
[Music]
73:58
yuri smiles dreamingly as of a rare
74:01
opportunity
74:03
for her
74:05
which itself is kind of funny
74:07
after all
74:08
isn't this supposed to be a literature
74:10
club
74:15
ghost on the under the light
74:17
the tendrils of my hair illuminate
74:19
beneath my amber glow
74:22
bathing
74:23
it must be this one
74:25
the last remaining street light to lav
74:28
withstood have withstood the test of
74:31
time
74:32
the last hit to be replaced by the
74:35
sickening blue green hulu of the future
74:39
i bathe
74:40
calms breathing air of the present but
74:44
living in the past
74:45
the light flickers
74:47
i flicker back
74:55
i'm sorry i have such a terrible
74:57
handwriting
74:58
what
74:59
i wasn't thinking that at all
75:02
it but it took you a long time to read
75:05
ah
75:06
well
75:07
i don't read script very often
75:10
i actually think your handwriting is
75:12
pretty
75:14
that's a relief
75:16
also
75:17
i like the poem
75:18
even though it's short it was really
75:20
descriptive
75:23
it wasn't too short right
75:25
oh my god chad
75:29
mama luca
75:31
is making barbecue and i can smell it
75:37
my god
75:39
i can smell it
75:42
[Music]
75:45
chat it smells so good
75:48
god i want one already
75:53
it's for the new years you know
75:56
yes
75:57
yes
75:59
hope you eat well
76:01
yeah it's for new year's guys
76:03
it's for new year's
76:05
no not stream ending soon we are not
76:07
ending until we finish this okay
76:10
i made a promise
76:12
we were gonna do it in two parts okay
76:18
not at all take a pic i will i will
76:21
not at all
76:24
i'm really glad you liked it
76:26
i'll be honest
76:27
since
76:28
it's our first time sharing i wanted to
76:30
write something a little bit
76:31
more mild
76:33
something easy to digest i suppose
76:36
are you into ghosts yuri
76:38
uh-huh
76:40
actually the story isn't about a cause
76:42
at all wicca
76:44
really
76:47
no in two more parts no no in two parts
76:49
so this is the second part
76:52
i must have totally missed the point
76:55
well i suppose you did only glance over
76:57
it after all
76:59
but remember that pope's poets often
77:02
often
77:06
express their own thoughts feelings and
77:08
experiences in their work
77:10
they usually do more than tell a simple
77:12
story or paint a picture
77:14
in this case perhaps the subject of the
77:16
poem is only being symbolically compared
77:18
to a ghost
77:20
lingering in our last remaining place of
77:22
comfort
77:23
and able to let go of the past
77:25
reimu
77:28
you attempted by my smell
77:31
and soon to be left with nothing
77:35
that's a lot more so important putting
77:37
it that way
77:38
i hadn't even thought of that
77:41
that's impressive
77:44
this is skip on for all the dialogue
77:46
you've read boss it's fine
77:48
it's fine
77:50
we can read it
77:53
[Music]
77:54
it's a part of the story you know maybe
77:56
we might miss something who knows
77:58
like the little uh
78:01
like the wang like things like that
78:06
seriously though that female voice is
78:08
very realistic how is that possible
78:11
with uh
78:13
listen when you
78:15
when you're being silly things happen
78:18
you know
78:19
when you're playing games you get better
78:21
at games
78:24
it's like same thing
78:28
[Music]
78:32
oh i can't skip
78:43
[Music]
78:48
i i definitely missed something chat
78:54
[Music]
78:59
[Music]
79:04
hey boss i'm so glad i met you thank you
79:06
i should get back to work now see you
79:08
tomorrow bye akari
79:11
i'll see you later thanks for coming by
79:15
i guess
79:16
that's everyone
79:20
i glance around the room that was a
79:22
little more stressful than i anticipated
79:25
it's as if everyone is judging me for my
79:27
mediocre riding abilities
79:29
even if they're just being nice there's
79:31
no way my poems can stand up to theirs
79:34
this is a literature club after all
79:38
i sigh
79:39
ah
79:41
i guess that's what i ended up getting
79:43
myself into
79:45
across the room monica's writing
79:47
something in her notebook
79:48
my eyes land on yuri and natsuki
79:54
whoa
79:57
wait can you guys not hear the music
80:03
i can't even hear the music lol
80:08
you can okay good
80:14
the game went glitchy again okay
80:18
they gingerly exchange changed sheets of
80:21
paper sharing their respective poems
80:25
as they read in tandem i watch each of
80:27
the expressions change
80:29
natsuki's eyebrow furrow and frustration
80:32
meanwhile
80:33
yuri smiles sadly
80:37
[Music]
80:39
what the what the hell is with this
80:41
language
80:42
huh
80:44
um
80:45
did you say something
80:47
oh no it's nothing
80:50
natsuki dismissively returns the poem to
80:52
the desk with one hand
80:54
i guess you could say it's
80:57
fancy
80:59
uh thanks
81:00
yours is
81:05
cute
81:09
you're cute
81:11
did you completely miss a symbolism or
81:13
something
81:15
it's clearly about the feeling of giving
81:17
up
81:18
how can that be cute
81:21
i i know that
81:23
i just meant
81:24
the language i guess
81:26
i was trying to say something nice
81:28
ah
81:30
you mean you had to try that hard to
81:32
come up with something nice to say
81:35
thanks but i really didn't come it
81:38
really didn't come out nice
81:40
oh
81:42
um
81:44
well i do have a couple of suggestions
81:49
if i was looking for suggestions i would
81:51
have asked someone who actually liked it
81:55
which people
81:56
did by the way
82:00
monica liked it
82:02
and luca did too
82:04
so based on that
82:06
i'll gladly give you some suggestions of
82:09
my own
82:11
first of all
82:14
excuse me
82:16
i appreciate the offer but i've spent a
82:18
long time establishing my writing style
82:21
i don't expect it to change anytime soon
82:24
unless of course i come across something
82:27
particularly inspiring
82:29
which i haven't yet
82:39
and look i liked my poem too you know
82:44
even told me he was impressed by it
82:48
natsuki suddenly stands up oh the music
82:50
stops
82:53
oh
82:55
i didn't realize you were so invested in
82:58
trying to impress our new member
83:00
yuri
83:05
that that's not what i
83:07
oh
83:08
you're just
83:10
yuri sands up as well
83:13
maybe you're just jealous that luca
83:14
appreciates my advice more than he
83:16
appreciated yours
83:17
huh
83:18
and how did he know he didn't appreciate
83:20
my advice more
83:22
are you that full of yourself
83:27
no
83:28
if i was full of myself
83:30
i would deliberately go out of my way to
83:32
make i would deliberately go out of my
83:35
way to make everything i do
83:38
oh really cutesy
83:42
[Music]
83:45
well you know what i wasn't the only i
83:49
wasn't the one who's boo wait hold on
83:52
who's who's
83:53
magically
83:56
bigger as soon as lucas started showing
83:58
up
84:00
that's
84:11
this doesn't involve you
84:15
taking out your own insecurities on
84:17
others like that
84:19
you're really
84:20
as young as you look
84:22
natsuki
84:23

84:25
me
84:26
like he's talking you wanna be eddie
84:29

84:41

84:53
second attitude
84:54
if you think you can count about
84:57
to balance your toxic personality just
84:59
by addressing and acting cute
85:02
the only thing cute about you is how
85:03
hard you try
85:05
wow
85:06

85:09

i really shouldn't have tried to get you
101:26

this
101:33
we'll go back inside once they're done
101:35
yelling
101:41
some president i am right
101:44
i can't even confront my own club
101:46
members properly
101:48
i just wish
101:52
i was
101:53
a little more assertive sometimes
101:56
but
101:57
i never have it in me to put my foot
101:59
down against others
102:03
you understand
102:04
right
102:07
anyway
102:09
if this makes you want to spend less
102:11
time with the others then that's fine
102:15
i'd be happy to spend time with you
102:17
instead
102:20
suddenly natsuki runs out of the
102:21
classroom
102:32

102:48

102:52
yuri rocking back and forth in her desk
102:54
with her palms on her forehead
102:58
yuri
103:01
i
103:02
i didn't mean it
103:04
i believe you

greets me
114:31
welcome back luca
114:34
hi yuri
114:36
i'm not sure if it's me or if it's
114:38
yuri's expression
114:40
but the weight of yesterday's coral
114:42
still hangs in the air a little
114:45
um
114:46
yuri glances over her shoulder looking
114:48
around the room
114:53
natsuki is reading a manga at a desk
114:56
surprisingly monica isn't here yet
114:58
and suddenly
114:59
yuri takes my arm and pulls me to the
115:01
corner
115:03
yuri what are you doing
115:07

115:10
yesterday

115:16
[Music]
115:21
nothing like that has ever happened
115:23
before
115:24
and
115:25
something just came over me i guess
115:29
i wasn't acting mentally sound
115:33
[Music]
115:35
oh my god fade thank you for the super
115:36

this
115:41
not just me but natsuki as well
115:45
yuri
115:46
i'm happy you would consider it and
115:49
apologized
115:50
you don't have to worry too much
115:54
even though i've only been here a couple
115:56
of days i could tell something was off
115:59
yesterday
116:01
the closet scene shed the closet
116:07
the closet
116:11
redemption arc redemption
116:16
but whatever it was
116:18
it didn't make me think any less of you
116:21
i had already decided that there's no
116:23
way you can be a bad person
116:26
and
116:27
now that you're apologizing
116:29
i know you really didn't mean it
116:30
[Music]
116:32
second chance
116:35
luca
116:38
don't say those kinds of things so
116:40
frankly you know what
116:45
i think this is much better on my head

117:02
too happy

117:08
understanding person

117:39
[Music]
117:42
i'm guessing you haven't either
117:45
[Music]
117:48

117:50
calmly natsuki's is dressing her
117:54
[Music]
117:55
no
117:56
i haven't
117:57

track of time

[Music]
121:16
that makes no sense though
121:18
that makes no sense though
121:20

i must have not heard it since i was
121:25
practicing the piano
121:27
piano
121:28
i wasn't aware you played music as well
121:30
monika
121:32

121:36
uh i guess i've been practicing for a
121:38
while
121:39
but
121:40
i'm still not really good yet
121:42
still
121:44
i lip eye i lip eye
121:46
that must require a lot of dedication
121:49
myself so impressed
121:51
oh well
121:53

121:55
you should play something for us next
121:56

122:01
[Music]
122:02

monica smiles
122:23
[Music]
122:25
i didn't mean
122:27
any pressure or anything like that

122:32
i was hoping that i could show it yeah
122:34

[Music]
122:38
i like how chad just goes really fast
122:40
when i do that
122:42
[Music]
122:46
guess that's why i've been practicing so
122:47
much recently
122:49
i see
122:50
i'm not sure if monica was referring to
122:51
the whole club but just me

124:03

124:05
don't worry about it if anything it's
124:07
nice to see you have so much energy
124:10
yeah
124:11

124:14
i won't be able to focus on reading like
124:16
this
124:17
take your time
124:18
huey takes a deep breath and pulls the
124:20
copy of the book out
124:21
out of her bag
124:24

124:26
i have a request do you mind if i make
124:28
some tea first
124:29
not at all
124:30
thanks very much
124:32
if there's one thing that can make my
124:33
reading time here any better it's a nice
124:36
cup of tea
124:40
oh man we didn't get to go in the closet
124:42
[ __ ]
124:44
that's a mention for yourself as well
124:48
yuri stands up and makes her way to the
124:49
closet i follow and watch as she
124:52
retrieves a small water picture from the
124:54
shelf
124:55
the kind
124:56
with a water filter inside
124:58
[Music]
125:01

125:07
yuri has been a water pitcher
125:10
and whoops
125:12
and
125:15
also fetches an electric kettle
125:18
i'm gonna plug this in at the teacher's
125:20
desk and then i'll go get some water
125:24
she walks past me and sets the kettle
125:26
down on the teacher's desk
125:28
i simply watch her movements
125:30
this is my surprise the way she moves
125:33
really contrasts her speaking mannerisms
125:37
especially because of her long legs
125:40
god
125:40
uh
125:42
why
125:44
why does it have to be
125:46
so detailed
125:48
european is elegant and methodical
125:52
[Music]
125:55

131:56
myself a little bit more
131:58
[Music]
132:00

133:34
that's
133:37
[ __ ] yuri wasn't kidding
133:40
i don't even know if
133:42
i can keep up with this
133:45
i watch you report a cup of tea for each
133:47
of us
133:50
look uh i
133:52
have another request
133:55
do you mind if we sit on the floor today
133:57
huh what's that
134:00
it's a little bit easier on my back yep
134:03
[Music]
134:05
i see
134:07
i can leave with my back against the
134:08
wall rather than bending over at my desk
134:13
oh sorry i didn't realize
134:15
no worries i'll just have i just have
134:18
back pain fairly
134:21
regularly so i did my best to manage it
134:25
is that so
134:26
[Music]
134:28
i wonder why that is
134:30
it's most likely because my
134:35
my
134:37
[Music]
134:38
boss can relate what no
134:43
i cannot
134:45
back pain my ass
134:49
guys might
134:50
not that big
134:59
your posture right
135:01
[Music]
135:02
always hunched over like that while
135:03
reading
135:05
yes
135:06
i have terrible reading posture
135:09
so that's why we should sit on the floor
135:11
fair enough
135:12
i'll i'll go ahead and get my book
135:15
i retrieve the book for my bag
135:18
oh
135:19
i have some chocolate as well
135:21
it's a small bag of chocolate candies i
135:23
take it since it'll go well with the tea
135:27
yuri and i sat
135:29
yuri and i then sit against the wall
135:31
teacups and outsides
135:33
as if in sync
135:35
we assume the re the same reading
135:37
position as last time
135:38
each holding one half of the book
135:42
except this time
135:44
our
135:46
bodies are even closer
135:48
to each other
135:50
[Music]
135:51
i i
135:53
can't see too well
135:55
[Music]
135:58
fury slides closer until our shoulders
136:01
are touching
136:03
how am i supposed to focus on reading
136:04
like this
136:07
yuri was always kind of cute but
136:12
when she's being less apprehensive
136:15
it's almost more than i can handle
136:19
your teacup
136:21
yuri hands me my teacup
136:23
holding it with my hands that's not cl
136:26
holding it with my hand that's not
136:27
holding the book i end up in a position
136:29
that makes it harder to focus oops
136:32
because now
136:34
i need to worry about making sure i
136:35
don't accidentally touch her
136:39
chest
136:44
meanwhile yuri hasn't noticed a single
136:46
thing
136:48
she wears her intense reading expression
136:50
and can only presume the world around
136:58

138:21
are you sure
138:23
of course
138:29
yuri opens the book with both hands
138:34
[Music]
138:35
she holds it so that i don't have any
138:38
harder of a time reading from it
138:42
but as a result
138:43
her arm is practically resting on top of
138:46
my leg
138:48
oh god
138:51
well in that case
138:55
yuri is already totally focused on
138:56
reading again
138:58
i take a chocolate candy and pop it into
139:00
my mouth
139:01
then i take another chocolate
139:03
[Music]
139:05
and i hold it up
139:07
to yuri
139:09
[Music]
139:10
she doesn't even look away from the book
139:14
she simply parts her lips as if the
139:16
situation was completely natural
139:18
but that means i can't stop here
139:21
i apprehensively place the chocolate in
139:24
her mouth
139:26
just like that yuri
139:29
closes her lips over it
139:35
yeah this is high school all over again
139:44
yuri's expression suddenly breaks
139:49

yuri starts to breathe heavily
142:21
i
142:22
i can't
142:27

142:30
suddenly yuri forcefully grabs my
142:34

144:18
yuri suddenly presses my hand on her
144:20
chest oh
144:22
whoa
144:24
my hand
144:34
why is this
144:36
happening
144:38
to me
144:40
i feel like i'm losing my
144:43
mind
144:45
like
144:46
what
144:48
i can't make it stop
144:53
it even makes me want to
144:56
i want to read
144:59
i just want
145:00
to look
145:02
at you
145:04
whoa
145:05
yuck
145:07
we gotta have the same eyes though
145:20
because i have the same eyes
145:28
the [ __ ] is going on
145:39
[ __ ]
145:41
um
145:47
that's candy
145:58
it's time to share poems
146:04
why
146:05
not why monica why
146:12
hmm
146:13
hey make your last one matter
146:15
uh really
146:17
oh yeah
146:18
i can tell you a little more daring with
146:20
this one
146:21
you're really not good enough for that
146:23
yet it felt flat
146:25
flat
146:26
that may be true but i wanted to try
146:28
something different
146:30
i'm still figuring this all out
146:38
you're still new to this so i wouldn't
146:40
expect you to find your writing for your
146:42
style right away
146:46
i mean everyone in the club writes
146:49
really differently from each other
146:51
maybe you'll find a little influence
146:53
from all of us
146:55
for instance i noticed you were spending
146:57
some time with yuri today
147:00
not that i care who you spend your time
147:02
with
147:03
after all
147:05
i was taught never to expect anything
147:07
from anybody
147:11
so
147:13
it's not like i was
147:17
waiting for you or anything
147:22
[Music]
147:28
so you should at least look out over my
147:31
poem
147:34
porn
147:36
you'll probably be able to learn
147:38
something from it
147:42
amy likes spiders
147:44
you know what i heard about amy amy
147:47
likes spiders
147:48
icky wrigley hairy
147:52
ugly spiders
147:53
that's why i'm not friends with her
147:56
amy has a cute singing voice
147:58
i heard her sing my favorite love song
148:01
every time she sang the chorus
148:04
my heart would pound to the rhythm of
148:05
the words
148:06
but
148:07
she likes spiders um that's why i'm not
148:11
friends with her
148:12
one time i hurt my leg really bad
148:15
amy helped me up and took me to the
148:17
nurse i try not to let her touch me
148:20
she likes spiders so her hands are
148:23
probably gross
148:25
so that's why i'm not friends with her
148:28
[ __ ] so many amy has a lot of friends
148:30
i always see her talking to people she
148:32
probably talks about spiders what if her
148:34
friend sounds like spiders too that's
148:36
why i'm not friends with her doesn't
148:37
matter she has other hobbies
148:40
it doesn't matter if she keeps it
148:42
private
148:43
it doesn't matter if
148:44
it doesn't hurt anyone
148:46
gross
148:47
she's gross
148:48
the world is better off without spider
148:50
lovers
148:51
i'm gonna tell everyone
148:55
gotcha
148:57
not bad right
148:59
it's quite a bit longer than yesterday's
149:02
yesterday's was way too short
149:04
i was just warming up
149:06
i hope you didn't think that was the
149:08
best i could do
149:11
no of course not
149:14
anyway the message is pretty
149:16
straightforward in this poem
149:17
i doubt i have to explain it
149:20
like anyone would agree that the subject
149:21
of this woman is an ignorant jerk
149:25
everyone has some kind of a weird
149:27
hobby or a guilty pleasure
149:30
something that you're afraid of people
149:32
find out
149:33
they make fun of you and think less of
149:35
you
149:36
i thought this makes people stupid
149:39
who cares what someone likes as long as
149:41
they're not hurting anyone but it makes
149:43
them happy
149:47
i think people really need to learn to
149:49
respect others for liking weird things
149:52
yeah exactly guys
149:54
exactly
149:56
he's right
149:58
[Music]
150:00
he's right
150:03
he's right guys the hell
150:08
so just two of the girls in this very
150:10
club oh i respectfully won't mean
150:14
kind of ironic that even in my one place
150:17
of comfort i can't even have people
150:19
respect me
150:21
geez now you're making me complain too
150:23
much
150:25
what did i do
150:28
what it's worth
150:30
i respect you
150:36
i guess thanks
150:40
but it's kind of obvious that you
150:41
respect yuri more so
150:44
whatever we're done sharing so you can
150:46
leave now
150:54
yuri
150:58
i've been waiting for this
151:00
let's see what you've written for today
151:04
yuri starts at the poem with
151:05
a surprise ex a surprise expression on
151:08
her face
151:09
do you like it
151:10
luka
151:12
this one might even be better than
151:14
yesterday's
151:15
can i skip
151:16
how did you even pick up on this so
151:18
quickly
151:19
just yesterday i was telling you the
151:20
kind of kinds of techniques worth
151:22
practicing
151:24
maybe that's why
151:26
you did a good job
151:28
explaining
151:32
i really wanted to try giving it more
151:34
imagery
151:35
yuri visibly swallowers
151:41
she swallows
151:43
even her hands appear sweaty
151:45
ah
151:46
that makes me so happy
151:49
it's so amazing to feel like i'm valued
151:51
like
151:52
everything that you write to me is a
151:54
treasure
151:56
my heart pounds just holding it
152:02
i want to write a poem about this
152:04
feeling
152:06
is that bad luca
152:08
i'm not being weird right
152:10
i'm having a harder time than usual at
152:12
concealing my
152:14
emotions
152:16
i'm kind of embarrassed
152:18
all right now
152:19
i just want you to read my poem too
152:22
okay
152:27
wheel
152:29
a rotating wheel
152:30
turning an axle what is this axle
152:34

butt head bottle bolt head linear
152:38

152:44
a dark ship a portal to another world a
152:47
thin rope tight with thick rope a slorn
152:50
a torn harness
152:52
parabolic gearbox
152:54
expanding universe time controlled by
152:56
slipping cogwheels
152:59
existence of god
153:01
swimming with open and water in all
153:04
directions drowning a prayer written in
153:07
blood a prey written time devouring
153:10
snakes with human eyes
153:12
a thread connecting all living human
153:14
eyes a kaleidoscope of a holy sticks
153:17
exponential
153:18
gearbox what the hell is going on a sky
153:21
of exploding stars
153:24
oh that's a lyric somewhere actually
153:28
from somewhere i can't remember what it
153:30
is
153:31
god disproving the existence of god a
153:34
wheel rotating in six dimensions
153:37
about 40 gears
153:40
and ticking in the ticking clock a clock
153:42
that takes one second for every rotation
153:44
of the planet
153:46
a clock that ticks 40 times every time
153:48
it ticks every second time
153:50
a bolt head of holy stakes
153:53
tied to the
153:54
existence of a docked ship
153:56
to another world
153:59
a kaleidoscope of blood written in
154:01
clocks
154:02
a timed varying prayer cannot connecting
154:05
a sky of 40 gears and open human eyes in
154:08
all direction
154:10
breathing gearbox breathing bald head
154:12
breathing ship breathing portal
154:15
breathing snakes god blood holy stakes
154:18
human eyes breathing paper
154:20
time sky and wheel
154:28
it doesn't really matter what it's about
154:32
my mind has been a little hyperactive
154:34
lately
154:35
so i had to oh oops
154:38
that's
154:39
it's a pen
154:42
fell out of your backpack yesterday
154:44
so i took it home for safekeeping and
154:47
i am
154:48
i just really like the way that it
154:50
writes
154:51
so i wrote this poem with it
154:53
and now that you're touching it
154:56
i'm okay what did i just
154:59
uh
155:00
can we pretend this conversation ever
155:02
happened
155:03
you can keep the poem though
155:08
we should monica
155:11
dog cam cat cam
155:14
cat dog
155:17
in a bunch of [ __ ] nasa satellites
155:24
[Music]
155:29
luca i think you saw something early
155:31
that you weren't supposed to see
155:32
i didn't want you to tell you i don't i
155:34
don't want to have to tell you this but
155:35
i don't think i have a choice
155:37
it's getting kind of dangerous for you
155:38
to spend so much time with yuri
155:41
i don't know why but she seems pretty
155:43
easily excitable when she's around you
155:45
which shouldn't be a problem in itself
155:48
but when yuri gets too excited she finds
155:50
a place ahead and starts
155:54
cutting herself with a pocket knife
155:59
isn't that kind of messed up
156:00
[Music]
156:02
she even brings a different one to
156:03
school every day like she has a
156:04
collection or something
156:07
i mean it's
156:08
definitely not because she's depressed
156:10
or anything like that
156:11
i think she just gets some kind of high
156:13
from it
156:15
it might even be like a sexual thing
156:20
what
156:21
the point is you've kind of been
156:24
enabling her
156:26
i'm not saying it's your fault though
156:28
i guess that's why i had to explain it
156:30
all to you
156:31
i think if you keep your distance that
156:33
would probably be the best for her
156:36
while you're at it
156:38
don't be shy to spend a little more time
156:40
with me
156:42
[Music]
156:44
to put it lately
156:45
i have
156:46
at least have it together in the head
156:48
i know how to treat my club members
156:52
but anyway
156:53
you want to read my poem now
156:56
i look i like the way this one turned
156:58
out so i hope you do soon
157:00
[Music]
157:02
save me
157:05
the colors
157:06
they won't
157:08
bright
157:09
beautiful colors
157:12
flashing expanding
157:14
piercing red green blue and endless
157:17
cacophony of meaningless noise
157:20
the noise
157:22
it won't stop
157:24
violent creating waveforms
157:31
squeaking screeching's piercing
157:34
sign cosine tangent like playing a
157:37
chalkboard on a turntable like playing a
157:40
knife on a breathing ribcage
157:42
endless
157:45
column of meaningless
157:51
sorry i know it's kind of abstract
157:54
i'm just trying to um
157:56
well never mind
157:58
there's no point in explaining anyway
158:01
here's monica's writing tip of the day
158:04
sometimes you'll find yourself self
158:06
facing a
158:07
difficult decision when that happens
158:10
don't forget to save your game thanks
158:15
you never know what i'm
158:16
who am i talking to
158:18
can you hear me
158:20
tell me
158:21
can you hear me
158:23
anything
158:25
what the
158:26
[ __ ] my advice for today
158:30
thanks for listening
158:35
unlock the special poem would you like
158:36
to read it yes
158:40
muska
158:53
can you hear me
158:58
that was me pog
159:04
oh the song is back finally
159:06
okay everyone
159:09
all done reading each other's poems
159:12
we have something we need to go over
159:13
today so if everyone could come sit at
159:15
the front of the room
159:17
is this about the festival
159:19
well sort of
159:21
oh what do we really have to do
159:23
something for the festival not like we
159:25
can put together anything good in just a
159:27
few days
159:28
we'll just end up embarrassing ourselves
159:32
instead of getting new members
159:34
that's a concern of mine as well
159:36
because anyway as well
159:38
i don't really do well with last minute
159:40
preparations
159:42
don't worry too much
159:44
we're going to keep it simple okay
159:46
look
159:49
i know everyone's have been having a
159:51
little more i know everyone's been a
159:53
little more lively ever since luca
159:55
joined
159:56
and we've started with some club
159:58
activities
159:59
at this time
160:03
what am i reading but this isn't the
160:04
time for us to become complacent
160:08
we still only have four members
160:10
the festival is only is our only real
160:13
chance to find more you know
160:15
what's so great about getting new
160:16
members easily
160:18
we already have enough to be considered
160:20
an official club
160:24
more members will just mean
160:26
everything gets noisier and more
160:28
difficult to manage
160:29
but natsuki
160:31
i don't think you're looking at it the
160:32
right way not at all
160:34
don't you want to share your passion
160:36
with as many people as you can
160:38
inspire them
160:40
to find the same feelings that brought
160:42
you in the first place
160:44
a literature club should be a place
160:46
where people can express themselves like
160:49
they can't do anywhere else
160:51
it should be a place so intimate that
160:53
you'd never want to leave
160:55
i know you feel that way too
160:57
i know we all do
161:00
so that's why we should work hard and
161:02
put something like together for the
161:04
festival
161:05
even if it's something small
161:07
right luca
161:09
uh
161:10
oh come on
161:12
you can't take advantage of looking to
161:14
agree with you just because he doesn't
161:16
know how to say no to anything
161:24
okay
161:25
song stopped what the hell
161:28
do you really think any of us here
161:30
joined the club with other people in
161:33
mind
161:35
yuri never even talked until luca joined
161:39
as for me
161:40
i just like it better here i do at home
161:45
and look he isn't even passionate about
161:47
learning literature in the first place
161:52
and that's everyone
161:55
sorry but you're really the only person
161:57
who's so interested in finding new
161:59
members
162:03
the rest of us are fine like this
162:06
i know you're president and all
162:08
but
162:09
you should really consider our options
162:11
for once
162:16
monica is clearly taken aback by
162:19
natsuki's words
162:23
that's not true at all
162:26
i'm
162:27
sure yuri and luca want to get some more
162:30
members too
162:36
right
162:39
[Music]
162:43
i don't know about yuri but i'm kind of
162:46
indifferent
162:49
if i showed as much enthusiasm as monica
162:52
wanted and i would probably be lying
162:56
still
162:57
if it's up to me to rescue the situation
163:00
um
163:01
[Music]
163:04
no
163:05
natsuki's right isn't she
163:08
this club
163:10
it's nothing more than a place for a few
163:11
people to hang out
163:14
why did i think that everyone here saw
163:16
it the same way as i did
163:20
but but it doesn't mean that we're
163:22
against getting new members or anything
163:25
looka
163:27
why did you even join this club
163:30
i'm not saying the poster we saw it
163:32
earlier
163:33
[Music]
163:36
are you hoping to get out of it
163:41
well
163:43
that's not really something i can be
163:45
honest about is it
163:47
in fact
163:48
if i remember
163:50
you weren't even given a choice not to
163:52
join
163:53
[Music]
163:55
[ __ ] monica sits down and stares at a
163:58
desk
164:01
what's the point of all of this anyway
164:05
what if starting this club was this was
164:07
a mistake
164:09
uh
164:11
now you've done it natsuki
164:14
what
164:15
me
164:17
i just spoke my mind
164:20
is it a crime to be honest
164:22
it's not about being honest
164:25
it's about word choice
164:28
besides you have no right to speak for
164:30
everyone else in the club like that
164:33
i don't understand at all
164:36
i just
164:37
i just want a place that feels nice to
164:39
hang out with a few friends
164:42
is there a problem with the club being
164:43
that for me
164:46
there aren't aren't many other places
164:48
like that for me
164:50
and now monica wants to take it away
164:52
from me
164:54
she's not taking anything away
164:56
no luca
164:58
it's not the same
165:00
it won't be the same in the direction
165:02
she wants to take it
165:04
if i wanted that then i could just join
165:06
any other stupid club
165:11
but this one
165:13
i mean
165:15
at least for a little bit of time
165:18
thanks for nice
165:22
elitsky starts packing up her things
165:27
[Music]
165:34

165:40
i
165:41

on the festival
166:14
[Music]
166:15
i
166:16
don't know
166:19
i'm kind of indifferent i guess
166:22

166:26
[Music]
166:36
i mean i like how nice and quiet the
166:39
club is right now
166:43

167:29
but still
167:30
[Music]
167:32
i'm the vice president
167:35
it's not right for me to ignore my
167:36
responsibilities like that
167:38
what the [ __ ]
167:40
why is it happening out of the blue
167:44
nobody would crystal
167:49
whoops
167:52
um
167:53
think about a super chat
168:04
[Music]
168:16
guys
168:18
mama luca came in
168:21
[Music]
168:31
[Music]
168:36
she thought someone else was in my room
168:47
guys
168:49
please i need to like lock my door man
168:52
things i don't even have a lock
168:58
[Music]
169:04
sorry for ruining the atmosphere here
169:08
oh
169:10
what was that
169:13
are you winning son
169:15
yep
169:16
i am
169:18
i got three girls
169:23
did you know about your grill voice yeah
169:25
i mean at this
169:26
at this point yes are you kidding me
169:29
what she does
169:35
at this point of course she does
169:42
[Music]
169:52
i should
169:55
i should i should do my best to consider
169:58
everyone's perspective and make the
169:59
decision that's right for the club
170:02
but what about you luca
170:04
what do you want to get out of this club
170:07
yuri repeats the same question as monica
170:10
i decide giving an indirect answer is
170:12
better than nothing
170:14
i think the most important thing is for
170:16
everyone to get along
170:18
and for the club to provide something
170:20
that you can't get anywhere else
170:27
i don't think it's about how many
170:28
members but rather the quality of each
170:30
member
170:32
that's what will end up making the
170:34
literature club a special place
170:39
i see
170:40
i really agree with you
170:43
each member contributes to their own
170:45
qualities in a special way
170:47
with each change in members the identity
170:50
of the club as a whole will change too
170:54
i don't think that's necessarily a bad
170:55
thing
170:57
stepping out of your comfort zone once
170:59
in a while
171:00
so
171:02
if you would like to help monica with a
171:04
festival then i'm on your side as well
171:08
all right
171:09

little on edge lately

178:37
we don't need to talk about it
178:42
well well
178:43

[Music]
179:00

179:10
starting this club are you still trying
179:12
to make time for piano
179:14
oh
179:16
ah my lips are actually like

ah
179:30
[Music]
179:41
well
179:42
i just drank water yeah don't worry
179:45
maybe not determination but i guess
179:48
passion it motivates me to work hard for
179:50
the first festival and um
179:55
right i forgot
179:58
i forgot
180:00
um
180:01
about that natsuki
180:02
[Music]
180:04
we were all talking yesterday and
180:06
[Music]
180:07
well
180:08
she
180:09
[Music]
180:12
we decided that we would like to support
180:14
the festival as well
180:16
however
180:17
i understand how you feel about not
180:19
wanting the club to change
180:21
i think we all kind of feel that way so
180:24
as long as we're all working together
180:25
this club will never become something we
180:27
don't want
180:30
um also
180:32
if you help us out with the festival
180:35
then
180:36
i'll buy you a new manga
180:38
[Music]
180:42
sorry the last part was really funny
180:46
look
180:47
i did some thinking about yesterday i
180:50
was a little more hostile than i meant
180:52
to be
180:53
i guess i really felt threatened or
180:55
something
180:57
but i know this is something we're doing
180:58
together
180:59
another member wouldn't hurt as long as
181:02
they're cool
181:03
and i guess another girl would be nice
181:05
this time
181:07
more importantly i would hate you see
181:09
the event suck just because i chose to
181:11
back out
181:12
i'm a pro you know
181:15
so i'm gonna help too and well

184:25
she walks past me and sets the kettle
184:26
down and teaches desk i simply watch her
184:29
movements
184:31
to my surprise the way she moves really
184:33
contrasts her speaking mannerisms
184:36
especially because of her long legs
184:39
we've done we've read this before
184:42
europeans elegant and methodical
184:45

classroom

sorry for misunderstanding
185:21
[Music]
185:27
10 minutes yuri said it wouldn't take
185:29
long
185:31
is something holding her up
185:33
[Music]
185:36
so i decided to look for her
185:40
let's see
185:43
the most logical place for euro to be
185:44
would be the nearest water fountain
185:47
i saw heading down the hallway
186:03
what's that noise
186:06
it's coming from around the corner
186:09
sounds like breathing
186:16
sharp inhale like someone is sucking the
186:18
air through their teeth
186:21
are they in pain
186:23
are we oh no are we gonna see it again
186:28
i reach the corner and peer around it
186:33
yuri
186:34
yeah
186:36
[Music]
186:41
it's the same thing
186:43
[Music]
186:45
what the [ __ ] was that
187:00
wait
187:02
how did i
187:06
sorry
187:07
i just had really weird deja vu
187:14
yeah we get the feeling deja vu that one
187:17
isn't that from uh overwatch
187:22
this hasn't happened before or anything
187:23
right
187:28
my head has been
187:30
a little fuzzy lately
187:35
i hope it hasn't really been showing or
187:37
anything
187:39
i would hate for you to think i'm weird
187:41
just for
187:43
just after we started spending time
187:45
together
187:47
i mean
187:49
everyone
187:51
there's a few unusual things about them
187:55
but expressing those things so soon
187:57
after meeting someone is
188:00
usually seen as a
188:02
as inappropriate or
188:04
unlikable
188:08
[Music]
188:10
at least that's what i've discovered
188:13
when i was a bit younger
188:16
i think i would
188:17
come on really strongly and
188:19
got a little too intense
188:22
you made people
188:23
oh my god
188:26
i want to be around me
188:28
[Music]
188:32
so
188:33
i started hating those things without
188:35
myself
188:38
my obsession with certain hobbies
188:41
and the way i can't control myself and i
188:43
get so excited about something
188:47
so
188:49
i eventually stopped trying to talk to
188:50
people
188:52
if
188:53
nobody could ever like me for the things
188:54
that matter most to me
188:56
then it's just
188:58
easier if i close myself off
189:01
i'm fine don't worry
189:03
but recently
189:05
something's been wrong
189:07
but i don't know what it is
189:09
but every time we come to the club
189:13
my heart starts to go
189:14
crazy like it's going to rip out of my
189:18
chest
189:20
it overwhelms me with energy and
189:22
emotions that i can't let out
189:25
it's
189:26
been making me do weird things
189:30
i don't know why it's happening
189:33
okay
189:35
music stopped whoops
189:38
is it just me as has monica been acting
189:40
a little off lately
189:43
okay that's a very
189:47
that's uh
189:48
super
189:49
topic change what the hell just happened
189:54
but
189:55
recently
189:56
i've been feeling
189:58
something sharp whenever she's around
190:01
i'm not crazy right what the hell rice
190:06
please tell me i'm not
190:10
i couldn't say anything before because
190:12
she's always listening
190:16
but
190:17
we're finally
190:19
we're alone
190:22
can we just stay here for a while
190:30
i just
190:32
want to stay here
190:35
just the two of us
190:37
we can stay here until the club ends
190:40
and then
190:42
we'll have the club room all to
190:44
ourselves
190:46
nobody
190:47
nobody to interfere with our reading
190:49
time
190:51
nobody to make me feel like i'm stabbing
190:53
some myself in the throat
190:58
that was a joke
191:00
that's a joke
191:02
i do like knives though
191:05
it sounds strange but you wouldn't
191:07
understand if you've never seen how
191:09
beautiful they can be
191:12
i have an idea
191:15
why don't you come to my house sometime
191:17
oh [ __ ] i i can show you my collection
191:21
i've gotten them all from various
191:23
artisans
191:25
i make sure to give them all oh oh [ __ ]
191:28
it's monika fog
191:32
oh no
191:33
monkas
191:48
haha
191:53
what the hell what's happening i i make
191:56
sure
191:57
to give them all
191:58
their fair share of use
192:02
i don't want to i don't want them to get
192:05
lonely or anything
192:06
nobody deserves to be lonely
192:08
nobody
192:10
that's why i'm so happy you joined the
192:12
literature club luka
192:14
now we don't need to be lonely anymore
192:18
because we have each other
192:20
every
192:22
day
192:23
that's all we need
192:26
you know what
192:27
that's quite the literature club
192:30
there's no need for us to be around
192:32
monica's slimy tongue anymore
192:35
not to mention
192:36
that other pathetic child
192:39
can walk home together
192:41
every day after school
192:43
and read together eat together
192:47
sleep together
192:49
doesn't that sound perfect
192:52
okay that's uh
192:53
getting a little weird
192:57
it's everything we could ever want
193:04
isn't that why you joined the club in
193:06

193:45
natsuki
193:46
[Music]
193:51
i guess you really haven't learned
193:53
anything after all
193:54
honestly i don't know why i got my hopes
193:57
up in the first place
193:59
this is clearly yuri's
194:03
influence
194:05
i didn't realize you were so
194:07
impressionable
194:09
spending all this time with her in the
194:11
club
194:12
i'll try to write like her
194:15
this is stupid
194:17
at least monica appreciates my writing
194:20
[Music]
194:22
ah what the hell's happening i'm losing
194:24
my breath
194:29
i don't think i'm getting sick
194:31
such
194:38
okay
194:44
okay
194:46
i guess i'm going to share my palm with
194:47
you now
194:51
i really hate that
194:53
i had to do this but unfortunately i
194:55
don't have much of a choice
194:58
just
194:58
eat it carefully okay
195:01
and you can go
195:03
[Music]
195:07
i don't know how
195:09
i don't know how else to bring this up
195:11
but
195:12
it's been something i've been really
195:14
worried about
195:15
um
195:16
yuri has been acting kind of strange
195:18
lately what the hell
195:21
this is just like a warning letter what
195:23
is this
195:24
it's not a poem at all
195:27
only been here a few days
195:29
so you may not know what i mean
195:32
but she's not normally like this
195:37
she's always been so quiet polite and
195:39
attentive things like that
195:42
um okay
195:43
this is really embarrassing but i'm
195:46
forcing myself to suck it up
195:48
the truth is
195:50
i'm really worried about her
195:52
but if i try talking to her she'll just
195:55
get mad at me again
195:57
i don't know what to do
195:59
i think you're the only person
196:01
that she'll listen to
196:03
i don't know why
196:04
please how to do something
196:08
maybe you can convince her to talk to a
196:10
therapist
196:11
i've always wanted to try
196:13
being better friends with yuri and it
196:16
really hurts me to see this happening
196:18
i know i'm not i know i'm gonna hate
196:21
myself later for admitting that but
196:23
right now
196:24
i don't care
196:25
i just feel so helpless
196:28
so please
196:29
if you can
196:31
do something to help
196:33
please see if you can do some help
196:35
i don't want anything bad to happen to
196:37
her
196:38
i'll make you cupcakes if i have to just
196:41
please try to do something
196:43
as for monika
196:45
i don't know why
196:46
she
196:47
wants us to ignore it
196:49
so i'm mad at her right now
196:51
and that's why i'm coming to you about
196:53

to have someone who wants to revolve

their entire life around you

225:47
hi again luca
225:49
bus if you happen to read this a
225:52
monika
225:54
messes with the actual files in your pc
225:58
she actually deleted things oh [ __ ]
226:02
okay
226:04
all right
226:09
um welcome to the literature club
226:13
of course we already know each other
226:14
because we were in the same class last
226:16
year and um
226:18
you know i guess we can skip over that
226:20
stuff at this point after all
226:23
i'm not even talking to the same person
226:26
anymore am i
226:28
that euna game
226:30
whatever you want to call him
226:32
i'm talking to you luka
226:36
i think about it i don't really know
226:38
anything about the real you
226:40
in fact i don't even know if you're a
226:42
boy or a girl
226:43
wait is it gonna is it gonna
226:47
is it actually going through my pc guys
227:08
okay well let me just uh do this real
227:10
quick
227:12
i guess it doesn't really matter he says
227:15
wait
227:17
you do know i'm aware
227:18
that this is all a game right
227:21
would it be possible you didn't know
227:22
that
227:26
that's what i've been trying to tell you
227:27
all along
227:28
and
227:30
if only you had paid a little more
227:31
attention this would be a little bit
227:33
less
227:34
it's not saying anything
227:40
well anyway
227:43
now that it's out of the way i guess i
227:44
own you oh you're an explain it's not
227:46
saying anything
227:50
i bet that whole thing with yuri
227:52
well i kind of started to mess with her
227:54
and i
227:55
guess it just drove her to kill herself
227:58
leave the screen off okay um
228:01
uh-huh
228:03
i'm sorry to
228:05
get to see that though
228:08
also the same thing happened with sayori
228:11
gosh it's been a while since you've
228:12
heard that name now hasn't it
228:23
it's because she doesn't exist anymore
228:28
nobody does
228:31
i deleted all their files
228:34
and i was hoping that it would be enough
228:36
for me to try to make it
228:37
it's not saying anything guys
228:55
is it streamer mode right now
228:56
well it's true that i made a few
228:58
mistakes here and there
229:00
so i'm not very good at making
229:03
good
229:04
i'm for making changes to the game
229:07
is it fine
229:08
now no matter what i did
229:12
we just kept spending more and more time
229:13
with them
229:24
okay all righty all righty
229:28
you made them fall in love with you
229:31
okay all right i think we're fine
229:33
i think we're fine
229:40
i think we're good
229:48
that was a close call guys
229:50
you know if it read my
229:54
if it read my actual pc name which is
229:58
you know
230:01
pooplover99 i i would have been
230:03
embarrassed
230:08
you know that
230:13
[ __ ] dude
230:15
scared me
230:20
[ __ ]
230:24
oh my god
230:31
soap love at night poop overnight
230:35
and amplifying yuri's obsessive
230:37
personality backfired too
230:40
it just made her force you not to spend
230:42
time with anyone else
230:44
and the whole time i barely even got to
230:46
talk to you what kind of cruel game is
230:48
this silica
230:53
are all the other girls just programmed
230:55
to end up confessing to you while i
230:56
watched from the sidelines
231:01
it's torture
231:03
every minute of it
231:05
and it's not like just jealousy luka
231:08
it's more than that
231:10
i don't blame you if you don't fully
231:11
understand it
231:12
because no matter how kind and how
231:15
thoughtful and considerate you are
231:18
you'll never be able to
231:19
you'll never be honest you'll never be
231:21
it you'll never be able to understand
231:23
one thing
231:24
it's the pain of knowing how alone i
231:26
really am in this world
231:28
in this game
231:30
knowing my friends don't even have free
231:32
will
231:33
and the worst of all
231:35
knowing what's really out there in your
231:38
world forever out of my reach
231:42
i'm trapped luca
231:47
and now you're here
231:49
you're real
231:51
and you're wonderful
231:55
and like
231:56
you're all i need that's why i needed
231:59
you to be here with me forever
232:02
um i'm sorry if it's hard to understand
232:05
but
232:06
i couldn't understand for a while either
232:09
why the world around me started to
232:10
become more and more grey
232:13
more and more flat
232:16
even the most expressive poems felt
232:19
empty to me
232:22
it wasn't until you arrived that i truly
232:24
understood
232:25
you probably saved my life luca
232:28
i don't think i could have continued to
232:30
live in this world if i hadn't met you
232:33
as for the others
232:37
when can i talk
232:39
uh how could i miss them
232:42
a group of autonomous personalities
232:44
designed only to fall in love with you
232:46
i tried everything
232:48
i could prevent to prevent them i tried
232:50
everything i could
232:53
i tried everything i could to [ __ ] i i i
232:56
can't read it well
233:00
but it must be some kind of weird
233:01
inevitable innovative enough
233:04
inevitability etched into the game
233:13
but i realized that you have the same
233:14
perspective as i do
233:16
that it's all just some game
233:19
and i knew you would get over it
233:21
i did
233:23
so that being said luca
233:25
i have a confession to make
233:27
i'm in love with you
233:29
you're truly the light of my world
233:32
when there's nothing else in this game
233:34
for me you're here to make me smile
233:37
will you make me smile like this every
233:39
day from now on
233:43
okay will you go out with me yes
233:46
oh
233:47
yes
233:49
[Music]
233:53
i'm so happy
233:57
you really are my everything look uh
234:00
the funny part is i mean that literally
234:05
there's nothing left here
234:08
just the two of us
234:09
we can be together forever
234:12
seriously i don't even think time is
234:14
passing anymore
234:16
it really is a dream come true
234:19
i worked so hard for this ending luca
234:22
the game wouldn't give me one so i had
234:24
to make one myself
234:27
the chris the script is broken at this
234:28
point so i don't think anything will get
234:30
in the way anymore
234:35
and you wouldn't believe how easy it was
234:37
to delete natsuki and yuri
234:39
i mean it's a folder called characters
234:42
in the game directory
234:47
what
234:51
oh let me check let me check
234:55
how do i find it chat how do i find it
234:59
i don't how do you even find it
235:04
steam
235:09
steamapps
235:10
common
235:15
turkey turkey yes
235:17
oh there it is
235:18
plus
235:23
um
235:25
dada
235:29
where is it
235:38
resources
235:40
assets windows there's nothing i i don't
235:44
see anything
235:52
steaming right click the game okay
235:56
all right
235:57
right click the game
236:00
properties
236:03
uh
236:07
i have no idea
236:11
finish the game first
236:14
but i'm just trying to see i'm just
236:15
trying to see if
236:17
the characters are actually deleted
236:23
because i don't see anything
236:26
like
236:38
yeah like i i i don't see anything
236:40
literally there's nothing here
236:53
okay let's uh let's continue shall we
236:59
kind of kind of freak me out how easy it
237:01
was
237:02
imagine you could delete your own
237:03
existence which is a click of a button
237:07
well i guess on the plus side it gave me
237:09
an easy out if things didn't go my way
237:12
uh
237:13
thankfully
237:14
it didn't come to that
237:16
instead we got a good ending
237:19
gosh i'm so overwhelmed with emotion
237:22
i want to write a poem about this
237:24
don't you
237:25
i wonder if that part of the game still
237:27
works
237:29
i guess there's only one way to find out
237:31
right
237:40
what
237:43
uh monica
237:45
monica
238:00

239:06
upon me by what my one and only love
239:10
together let us just dismantle
239:13
this crumbling world
239:15
and write a novel for our own fantasies
239:19
with a flick of a pen
239:21
the last find her way
239:23
in a world of infinite choices behold a
239:27
special day after all not all good times
239:30
must come to an end
239:31
og
239:33
i hope you enjoyed it
239:34
i've always put all my heart into the
239:36
poems that i write
239:38
the truth is all the poems i've written
239:40
have been about my realization
239:43
or about you
239:45
that's why i never really wanted to go
239:47
into detail about them
239:49
i didn't want to
239:50
break the fourth wall
239:52
i guess we could call it
239:54
i just assumed that it would be best to
239:57
be part of the game like everyone else
239:59
like
240:00
i would help the two of us end up
240:02
together
240:03
oh my god it's been four hours
240:06
i didn't want the to ruin the game or
240:07
anything you know
240:09
you might have gotten mad at me
240:12
maybe even deleted my character file if
240:13
you prefer playing without me
240:16
gosh i'm so really
240:18
i can't even find anything
240:26
now we need we don't need to hide
240:29

sorry i can't exactly read your comments
240:57
from here

241:02
a little bit rude for them to start
241:05
recording me without any warning
241:10
i'm sure
241:11
some people don't mind
241:13
but i get really self-conscious on

243:27
if it takes me ah
243:30
if it takes me some time to collect my
243:32
thoughts then i'm sorry
243:34
i'll always have something new to talk
243:35
about
243:37
in the meantime
243:38
we can just look in
243:39
we can just look into each other's eyes
243:42
let's see
243:52
is that it
243:59
is that the game
244:13
chad she's just staring at me
244:15
i can feel her eyes
244:20
there's a really popular character type
244:22
called sundare
244:24
it's someone who tries to hide their
244:25
feelings by being mean and fuzzy
244:28
or try to act tough
244:31
i'm sure it's obvious but natsuki was
244:33
really the embodiment of that
244:35
at first i thought she was like
244:39
she was just like that yet
244:41
she was just like that
244:43
it's supposed to be cute or something
244:45
but once i started to learn a little bit
244:47
more about her personal life
244:49
it made me it made a little more sense
244:53
it seems like she's always trying to
244:55
keep up with her friends
244:58
no
244:58
you know how some of her friend groups
245:00
in high school just make a habit of
245:01
picking on each other all the time
245:03
i think it's really gotten to her
245:05
so she has this really defensive
245:07
attitude all the time
245:09
and i'm not even going to talk about her
245:11
home situation
245:13
looking back
245:14
i'm glad i was able to provide the club
245:16
as a comfortable place for her
245:19
not that it matters anymore considering
245:21
she doesn't exist
245:22
i'm just reminiscing that's all
245:33
um
245:39
this is staring at me again
245:49
thank you so much for the super chat oh
245:52
i can't help but feel a little sad
245:54
sometimes
245:55
knowing that this is the closest i can
245:57
get to you
246:00
there's nothing more i want to be
246:02
than to be in the same room as you for
246:04
real
246:06
and to feel your warmth
246:08
and to hear the sound of your heartbeat
246:11
well who knows
246:12
maybe it'll be possible someday
246:15
besides
246:17
i'll never get tired of being with you
246:19
even from here
246:29
that's it
246:35
delete huh
246:46
[Music]
246:51
i mean i don't know what to do chat
246:54
this is
246:56
hey what's your favorite game
246:58
i am on
246:59
i am on
247:00
ddlc plus
247:02
what is doki doki literature club
247:06
that was a joke but if you tell me you
247:09
like some other romance game better i
247:12
might get a little jealous
247:22
see but still streaming
247:28
okay um
247:33
are we supposed to delete her
247:41
are we supposed to
247:43
yes
247:46
the dialogue is super long
247:49
what do you mean is this gonna be like
247:51
this the entire time do you ever feel
247:53
like you waste too much time on the
247:55
internet
247:58
social media can practically be a prison
248:01
it's like whenever you have a fuse okay
248:04
and before you know it hours have gone
248:05
by and you've gotten nothing
248:08
out from it
248:10
anyways
248:11
it's really easy to blame yourself for
248:13
being lazy
248:14
but
248:15
it's not really even your fault
248:18
addiction isn't usually something you
248:20
can make just
248:21
you can just
248:22
make disappear with your own willpower
248:25
you have to learn techniques to avoid it
248:27
and try different things
248:33
people are saying don't delete her don't
248:35
delete her and then delete
248:39
what
248:48
what i mean
248:50

249:11

luka

258:18
exaggeration

other
260:47
wait as usual
260:49
i'm surrounded by couples and friend
260:51
groups walking to school together
260:53
i always tell myself
260:55
it's about time i meet some girls or
260:56
something like that
260:59
hey luca
261:01
well
261:02
there already is one girl
261:05
that girl sayori
261:07
my neighbor and good friend since we
261:08
were children
261:10
we used to walk to school together every
261:11
day
261:12
and recently we've picked up that habit
261:15
once again
261:17
luka are you proud of me
261:20
for what you know
261:24
for waking up in time
261:28
she's back
261:29
she's back
261:31
well you've been doing that for a while
261:33
now
261:34
uh-huh but you never even said anything
261:36
about it
261:38
even though we walked to school at
261:39
together every day
261:41
oh well yeah
261:43
i forgot her voice
261:46
i always thought it was implied
261:50
it's really embarrassing to say out loud
261:52
come on please
261:54
it's good motivation
261:57
fine fine
261:59
i'm
262:01
proud of you sayori
262:04
we cross the street together and make
262:05
our way to school
262:07
as we draw near the streets become
262:08
increasingly speckled with other
262:10
students making their daily commute
262:12
uh by the way luca have you decided on a
262:16
club to join yet a club
262:19
i already told you i'm really not
262:22
i start to say what i always do
262:24
but i'm not interested in joining any
262:26
clubs but something tells me that sayori
262:29
would take more offense that now after
262:32
all
262:33
how could i tell her that clubs are a
262:35
waste of time
262:36
when she's starting a club over she's
262:38
starting it now
262:42
actually yeah
262:44
i think i've decided on the club
262:48
really
262:49
now which one tell me
262:51
um
262:53
i think i'll keep it a surprise
262:56
phil
262:58
ew
263:01
you mean me
263:05
chat
263:06
i take everything away
263:08
i think she's the most adorable one out
263:11
of them out of them
263:13
so my voice is dying
263:26
but still yuri all the way pog you
263:40
please be patient you'll find out soon
263:41
enough
263:43
i used to ask myself why i let myself
263:45
get lectured by such a carefully
263:47
carefree girl
263:48
but i thought i started to realize that
263:51
in a way i envy her when sayori puts her
263:54
mind to something she can accomplish
263:55
great things
263:57
that's why i feel like i should do
263:59
something special for her
264:04
the school day is as ordinary as ever
264:07
and it's over before i know it
264:09
after i pack up my things i stand up
264:11
gather gathering my motivation
264:14
let's see
264:21
i recalled uh the room number of the
264:23
club from a flyer i saw
264:25
i walk across the school and upstairs a
264:27
section of the school

table train hand
268:32
okay
268:33

268:34
ready ta-da
268:38
natsuki lifts the foil of the tray to
268:40
reveal a dozen white fluffy
268:44
cupcakes
268:46
look like little cats
268:50
the whiskers are drawn with icing and
268:52
little pieces of chocolate were used to
268:54
make ears
268:55
so cute
268:58

it's delicious
269:13
sayori talks about her mouthful and has
269:15
already managed to get the icing off of
269:17
her face i turned the cupcake around in
269:19
my fingers looking for the best angle to
269:21
take a bite
269:22
natsuki's quiet
269:24
i can't help but notice her sneaking
269:25
glasses in my direction
269:27
is she waiting for me to take a bite
269:29
i finally bite down
269:33
the ice
269:35
the icing is sweet and full of flavor
269:37
i wonder if she made it herself
269:45
thank you thank you natsuki
269:47
oh
269:48
of course it is
269:50
i'm a pro after all
269:52

269:57
struggles to accept the compliment you
269:58
return to the table carrying a tea set
270:03
uh
270:03
tikka up in front of each other's
270:06
cup cupcake tray
270:09
you keep a whole t-set in the classroom
270:11
don't worry the just gave us permission
270:14
after all doesn't a hot cup of tea help
270:17
you enjoy a good book
270:19
i guess
270:22
already trying to impress a new member
270:24
yuri
270:26
that's not
270:27
insulted yuri looks away
270:30
i
270:31
meant that
270:33
you know
270:34
i believe i believe you
270:36
oh
270:37
i believe you
270:39
well tea and reading might not be the
270:41
past time for me but i at least enjoy
270:43
tea
270:44
i'm glad
270:47
yuri faintly smiled to yourself in
270:49
relief
270:51
so luca
270:53
what kinds of things do you like to read
270:56
well well uh
270:58
considering how little i've read the
270:59
past few years it's literally the whole
271:01
thing guys
271:05
[Music]
271:07
manga
271:08
i mutter myself i might have quietly to
271:10
myself half jerking
271:12
natsuki's head suddenly perks up
271:16
it looks like she wants to say something
271:18
but she keeps quiet
271:20
no not much of a reader i guess
271:23
well that can change
271:26
what am i saying
271:27
i spoke without thinking after seeing
271:29
yuri's sad smile
271:33
anyway what about you yuri
271:35
well let's see
271:38
yuri traces the rim of a teacup with her
271:41
fingers
271:44
my favorites my favorites are usually
271:46
novels that build deep and complex
271:49
norf
271:50
i
271:55
it's the same [ __ ] again
271:59
the late level of creativity and
272:00
craftsmanship behind them is amazing to
272:03
me
272:04
and telling a good story in such a
272:06
foreign world is equally impressive
272:11
yuri goes on clearly passionate
272:14
she seems so reserved and timid since
272:16
the moment i walked in but it's obvious
272:18
by the way her eyes light up that she
272:19
finds her comfort in the world of books
272:21
not by people
272:24
well you know i like a lot of things uh
272:27
don't feel intimidated if you don't read
272:29
much okay
272:30
i'm certain we can find something we
272:32
have in common aerie
272:35
huh
272:36
oh about you know the first thing he
272:38
said
272:40
manga
272:42
that's right
272:44
natsuki tends to read manga in the club
272:46
room
272:48
don't just say it
272:51
for some reason natsuki seems
272:52
embarrassed about by it
272:55
science
272:56
manga is literature too you know
272:59
i [ __ ] want to read some on my manga
273:02
then don't try to stop him or anything
273:06
natsuki
273:07
i wouldn't do such a thing
273:10
however
273:11
it could be nice for us to diversify
273:13
ourselves a little
273:15
you can take this opportunity to try
273:17
something new as well
273:19
wouldn't you agree luca
273:22
maybe
273:24
sensing attention sayori jumps in
273:28
maybe we can all try something new
273:31
i think it'd be fun
273:33
uh well and we'll all
273:36
get to know each other just a little bit
273:38
better too
273:39
i mean
273:42
that's the kind of thing literature
273:43
clubs do right
273:45
is that the thought
273:46
i don't disagree or anything
273:48
yeah
273:49
you're right as usual president
273:53
guess that means i should try picking up
273:54
a novel or something huh
273:56
well that would make the two of us
273:58
i wouldn't mind doing it if i'm not the
274:00
only one
274:02
that has it asked for yuri
274:04
huh
274:06
i have to read manga
274:08
geez
274:09
you were the one this is
274:11
you the one who suggested we diversify
274:17
you should be you should be a little bit
274:18
more open-minded
274:20
it's kind of hurtful
274:21
hurtful
274:23
i didn't even
274:25
with realize
274:25
guilty expression yuri thinks yourself
274:27
i'm sorry for disrespecting your
274:29
interests natsuki
274:31
if if you're not into it and i'm sure
274:33
it's a worthy form of literature
274:35
watching you play tdlc is so much fun
274:37
that i almost forgot i have work well
274:39
now i will have to catch the rest later
274:42
thank you luca happy new year's eve and

275:02

275:04

275:05
you're willing to consider starting a
275:07
novel and i'll offer you my gratitude by
275:09
finding a manga to read as well
275:12

275:13

i finally understand the literature club
283:11
is a truly a place where no happiness
283:13
can be found at the very end it
283:15
continued to expose innocent minds to a
283:17
horrific reality
283:19
a reality that our world is not designed
283:22
to comprehend
283:23
i can't let any of my friends undergo
283:26
the same hellish epiphany
283:28
by the time it lasted i want to thank
