301:25
you still have to wake up
301:26
regularly for collabs uh sometimes um
301:30
[Music]

301:35

306:55

307:01
imagine a kit kat you know how it has
307:03
like
307:04
on the sides
307:06
like just pure chocolate
307:09
not not wafers like on the sides
307:12
bars yeah
307:13
it's literally a chocolate bus what i do
307:16
is i snap the uh the corners first
307:19
all of that around
307:22
until i see the wafer
307:24
the triangle the the rectangle
307:26
wafer
307:28
and what i do is is i bite the top bit
307:31
until i finish it
307:33
until i get to the bottom
307:36
i i like take the layers one by one
307:44
[Music]
307:49
yeah i take the lanes one by one it's
307:51
like buying it
307:56
[Music]
307:58
yeah
308:00
exactly just like that
308:02
[Music]
308:03
you're tempted by my smell like a bee
308:06
that takes honey
308:10
you got it
308:12
of course you do
308:14
chad i don't think people understand
308:16
but
308:18
food tastes different if you eat it a
308:20
different way
308:25
[Music]
308:28
it tastes different if you eat it
308:29
differently
308:30

i don't know it adds some fun to it you
308:40
know

what's what obviously
309:10
if i do that chocolate would melt
309:14
you see
309:15
that
309:16
that's why
309:17
that's why the way i eat it
309:20
is only recommended for experts and
309:22
professionals okay
309:24
see someone like me i can regulate my
309:26
temperature to really really cold to the
309:28
point that the chocolate won't even melt
309:31
or or or you could be more technical
309:34
with it and actually put it in the
309:35
freezer okay
309:37
take it out of the freezer and start
309:39
