170:21
or else like it kills the momentum
170:24
oh headshot headshot
170:27
headshot
170:29
one shot one kill
170:35
okay how the hell did i
170:37

go without me luca okay
171:54
now it's not glitchy
171:56
i can't see
171:58
i think it's i think it's because when
172:00
one one person is dangling outside it
172:02
kind of kills the
172:04
momentum
172:06
no glitch not glitchy anymore pog

he was he was getting mad on roblox so
336:55
much
336:56
that he like throws the the
336:58
the ipad
336:59
and it just shatters like the screen is
337:02
correct
337:04
you can't even see anything anymore
337:07
what he does was hide it behind the
337:09

337:10
so that no one would ever find it
337:12
wow
337:13

337:42
the ipad kid
337:44
like example right there
337:47
playing roblox on the ipad like
337:52
intensely how do you even get mad at
337:55
roblox
337:57
like
337:58
i i can't think of any like a reason to
338:00
get mad at firefox
338:03
oh
338:04
i played that like squid game parody oh
338:08
yeah me too like that yeah yeah yeah and
338:11
then you know the marbles game
338:14
on there huh where you have to guess odd
338:16
or even
338:17
oh yeah yeah
338:19
i missed every single one
338:25
you always go even even even all the
338:27
time i did yeah i did go even like four
338:30
times in a row and i missed four
338:34
even all the time yeah and then i lost

338:38
and then i was a little upset after that
338:40
honestly
338:42
i mean the game the game takes such such
338:44
a long time to get to that point though
338:46
yeah that was like my first time getting
