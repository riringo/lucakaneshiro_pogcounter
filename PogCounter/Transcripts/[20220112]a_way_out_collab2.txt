i'm not mistaken
173:32
i wonder if you could have both survived
173:34
i don't know
173:36
i'll have to look that up later
173:42
but it doesn't feel like this is the
173:43
kind of game that gives you an ending
173:44
like that
173:46
which i like
173:48
[Music]
173:52
still stings though
173:54
yeah
174:01
[Music]
174:27
there it is
174:28
we did the game we finished the game
174:33
oh my god
174:36
ah
174:37
what a journey and what a twist and what
174:40
an ending
174:42
less than six hours too easy
174:48
i don't know where it said eight hours
174:50
long but
174:51
that was that was pretty fast
174:55
stay short but sweet i would say
175:01
oh
175:03
that was pretty cool
175:04
yeah i was like
175:09
that was a really good game
175:11
yeah it was
175:13
i broke out of jail but at what cost i'm
175:15
dead i'm dead
175:21
oh my god
175:24
ah
175:28
still i'm glad we got to play this
175:29
together thank you for agreeing to play
175:31
this with me luke it was so much fun
175:33
yeah i actually
175:36
had the idea i think before we debuted
175:39
yeah i pitched this i i told him like
175:42
the moment i get like i get released
175:44
from twitter jail we're planning to to
175:46
play a way out yeah
175:50
and i'm glad that we did such a fun game
175:52
the only thing i'm a little bit
175:53
regretful about is the technical hiccup
175:55
the fact that my computer just up and
175:56
died in the middle of the stream
175:59
yeah
176:00
but hey we still
176:02
so kind of made it
176:04
on time though before the three years
176:06
made it work we made it work yes hey
176:08
thank you for super chat radio behemoth
176:09
thank you yeah that was that was crazy
176:11
that was a crazy game
176:13
oh my god quite the journey i think that
176:16
out of everything ironically the thing
176:17
we struggled the most was with was the
176:20
freaking
176:21
rowing the boat down the river yeah
176:23
that's probably what that the most that
176:24
was the hardest part definitely yeah
176:29
jesus
176:31
that was such a fun time though
176:33
it was
176:35
are there other games like this i wonder
176:37
um i know that the people who made this
176:40
game also made it takes two
176:42
[ __ ] they have that
176:45
i don't but i've heard that it's really
176:47
really yeah i think i i saw i saw elira
176:51
play it a little bit
176:53
but and i i think mista played it with
176:56
anna senpai and petra senpai also played
176:58
it with oliver senpai oh okay
177:04
i see
177:06
i heard that game's like
177:08
the chat is yelling at us to play it
177:10
takes two together we'll see
177:11
we'll see
177:15
bear thank you
177:19
oh man oh that was a lot of credits
177:22
even though is this an indie game
177:25
i have no idea
177:26
like the game is like
177:28
this is a lot of people for an indie
177:29
game
177:33
yeah yeah the game the game had a lot of
177:37
like mechanics so
177:38
yeah it did probably took a long time
177:41
um all the mini games were a lot of fun
177:43
i mean i like that they sprinkle those
177:45
out a little bit
177:49
except for the baseball one
177:50
except for the baseball one the basil
177:54
that was the best one
177:56
no no it was not
178:01
[Music]
178:04
that was the best one what are you
178:05
talking about
178:07

178:12
oh
178:13
i've never been that angry at a mini
178:15
game in my life
178:16
really
178:18
like i was i was genuinely frustrated
178:21
over the fact that no matter what button
178:22
timing i put it just went straight off
178:25
to the right no matter what i did
178:29
i was distracting you too yeah and that
178:32
that obviously didn't help if i feel you
178:34
were psyching me out
178:35

270:07
heartbroken
270:10
and
270:11
i just yeah i
270:15
stayed in my room looked at my guitar
270:18
and i started learning it
270:20
while singing at the same time
270:22
and i just did that for like uh yeah
270:25
i think a whole year straight
270:29
probably like a year and a half but
270:37
that's how i learned how to sing
270:39
[Music]
270:42
so yeah i'm very self-taught at all
270:44
i have never gotten lessons ever
270:46

271:14
trying something
271:16
you know when guys
271:21

271:23
they kind of go overboard and do
271:26
things they've never done yeah it was
271:27
like that
271:28
but i wasn't really like
271:30
sad about it like well i was sad about
271:32
it but
271:34
you know i i don't know i was motivated
271:36
i guess
271:40
i was very motivated to just continue
271:43
[Music]
271:46
yeah like i
271:47
[Music]
271:48
you know well i'm not

272:04
that's that's the story
272:11
oh
272:13

272:18
guys uh the thing is i i'm not even like
272:24

273:01
all that
273:03
all that hard work
273:05
all that all that practicing
273:08
can be put to use
273:24
it paid up in the end
273:28
yeah i mean it's uh
273:31
and the fact that i can do a
273:33
like
273:34
a convincing female voice also
273:37
