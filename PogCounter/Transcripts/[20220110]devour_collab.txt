53:47
the next time
53:49
let's let's all grab the last four eggs
53:51
and do it together
53:52
i think
53:53
but we need to cleanse water every like
53:55
after one egg though
53:57
yeah but you can activate the eggs
53:59
whenever
54:01
oh should we do it again i think
54:04
i think what the strat
54:06
that we used before is like we collect
54:09
all of the
54:10
[Music]
54:12
exclusions like in one corner and then
54:14
we put them all in a corner oh that is
54:16
white we could do that
54:18
because the spiders
54:22
no they don't they only take the jews or
54:24
they only take the eggs don't like the
54:25
other items what the [ __ ]
54:28
um try doing that
54:30
yeah i think we got it this time
54:33
go pretty close so low enough yeah let's
54:35
go get get something to drink
54:37
yeah me too
54:40
hey
54:41
i'll be right back let's just make a
54:42
mountain of items the next time this is
54:44
the only perk i have i love pony i love
54:48
it
54:53
[Music]
54:54
is to just leave and let someone else
54:56
deal with the spider woman true what's
54:58
the actual strap do you think oh
55:02
just let the spider woman have like
55:04
every time it's gonna be fine so what is
55:06

gold one are the most difficult
175:04
what i thought this one was
175:06
difficult
175:07
no i think this one i thought the spider
175:09
was more difficult and annoying because
175:10
i thought the spider was more difficult
175:13
yeah
175:14
yeah i found that
175:16
i don't know with this one
175:18
it wasn't like
175:20
the monster wasn't really everywhere
175:23
yeah it felt a bit more manageable and
175:25
like the the wheelchair dudes were
175:27
infinitely easier to deal with than the
175:29
spiders
175:31
maybe that's true
175:32
the spiders were everywhere
175:35
yeah you had to find the freaking altars
175:37
and stuff like that it was really
175:39
annoying although fighting the rats was
175:41

[Music]
199:46
p4 gore
199:50
i mean i'm not really bad with
199:52
remembering names but i don't know why
199:54
like i just cannot remember their names
199:56
i have no idea
199:59
i have no idea
200:04
i do i i literally forgot skull emoji
200:07
yeah
200:10
it's okay your memory seems very
200:12
photographic
200:14
it's not it really isn't
200:23
[Music]
200:25
where your friends now yep
200:31
yeah my my actual like friends that i
200:35
[Music]
200:36
kind of hang out with used to hang out
200:38
with
200:39
they they live in a different city so i
200:42
i can't really
200:43
[Music]
200:46
i can't really visit them that much
200:55
i mean
200:57
wait can't you relate you meet a person
201:00
you don't ask their name
201:02
and you kind of just hang out with them
201:05
can't you relate
201:11
you never ask their name
201:13
you can you just hang out with them
201:25
it's probably different in my case
201:27
because
201:28
we were a class right
201:30
and
201:32
whenever our names are kind of cold
201:34
we kind of just say present
201:36
we kind of expect people to know
201:39
our names already i think that's why i
201:41
think that's why
201:43
[Music]
201:48
don't you introduce yourself to each
201:49
other
201:50
i mean no we don't we don't really
201:54
it it's it's it's weird it's weird like
201:56
imagine you you're sitting by a bus stop
202:01
and you see your classmate
202:03
you know he's your classmate because
202:05
he's in your class right obviously
202:08
and you're like yo how how you doing
202:10
dude
202:13
you wanna you wanna go grab something
202:14
you eat i don't know you just don't
202:16
sometimes you just don't ask them
202:30
yeah
202:32
they ask yours
202:34
it's like a feeling you know
202:38
it's kind of like a mutual feeling
202:40
[Music]
202:46
yeah and asking people's name is a
202:47
little awkward too what's your name
202:48
again you know like uh
202:52
oh oh you you reach out handshake oh i'm
202:55

203:02
kind of weird
203:07
