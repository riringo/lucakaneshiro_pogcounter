actually means
61:41
the term
61:42
the term pog
61:44
now the term comes from the word
61:47
hog
61:48
which is a gaelic for kiss
61:51
you know it was started by disgruntled
61:54
navy sailors of irish descent who served
61:57
during the american civil war um they
62:00
were upset that others you know would
62:02
never leave the shore
62:03
uh
62:04
they would actually get to stay home and
62:06
get all the kisses from the ladies while
62:08
they were out fighting so that was
62:10
pretty pog
62:11
at that
62:13

97:27
right and
97:34
i i uh i i
97:36
i go with a group always so with my
97:38
friends obviously
97:41
and
97:42
sometimes it'd be you know
97:45
the girls there too
97:47
that
97:48
we've known since high school for
97:50
example
97:51
and
97:52
we just
97:55
i i just look at their drink
97:57

98:42
oh
98:45
by looking at orange juice
98:47

98:51
i do i do prefer
98:53
um
98:56
i do i do prefer
98:58

99:04
i do prefer orange juice not gonna lie
99:06
orange is not bad chat
99:08
don't don't talk smack about it
99:11
rin
99:12
may i know what the difference between
99:14
stream labs and super chat i don't know
99:17
oh oh so the difference between uh super
99:20
chat and stream labs
99:22
i'm not even allowed to say this
99:25
i think
99:27
well
99:28
uh
99:31
again i i don't really expect to to to
99:34
be super chatted so so much so i i just
99:37
try to read
99:39
every super chat every donation through
99:41
streamlabs
99:43
and
99:44
but right now it's very hard to keep up
99:45
since there's so many
99:47
um
99:49
but the difference is if you
99:52
if you super chat i can see the super
99:55
chat like in chat right now
99:58
uh but the thing is youtube does take a
100:01
percentage of that
100:03
so
100:04
compared to stream labs
100:08
the streamlabs
100:09
they youtube doesn't at all
100:11
so
100:15
[Music]
100:18
yeah
100:21

i feel like sick i feel like two hours
132:48
into that your whole body just freezes
132:50
it just locks in place right
132:58
yeah i don't even know the thing is
133:00
that's that that's that's longer than a
133:02
sleep cycle
133:04
like
133:07
you could literally watch this person do
133:09
a plank go to sleep wake up he's still
133:11
planking
133:16
isn't that crazy
133:24

like by the way like even
133:39
like five minutes is a lot is is
133:43
is pretty
133:45
is good it's actually good for a plank
133:48
five minutes is good i'm just saying
133:50
five minutes is good
133:57
eight hours is is actually
134:03
it's god level
134:16
the light sticks are big again yeah they
134:18
are
134:27
what are you even playing for so long
134:31
i don't know i
134:33
one day i was just like
134:36
okay
134:37
i think
134:39
i'll i'll do i'll just do this every
134:41
morning and every night
134:43
you know wake up
134:45
like watch
134:46
watch like a video
134:50
and then and do it as
134:53
as much as i can
134:58
and i
134:59
kind of just stayed like that every
135:01
single day
135:09
like yeah you kind of just like you
135:12
start doing it because
135:13
why not
135:16
you just end up doing it the entire time
135:19
when are you going to stream ring fit oh
135:21
uh
135:23
oh man i actually don't know
135:25
the thing is
135:27
my my ring fit gear might come
135:31
early next week or like late next week
135:33
so i'm not really sure
135:35
i might have to do ringfit at very
135:38
like last day of the week
135:50
do you have a fitness person up
135:52
what
135:53
you have a favorite fitness personality
135:55
online on youtube or can you recommend
135:56
anyone ah
136:01
um
136:04
no not really like i
136:09
i'm my own fitness person
136:11
i wouldn't even call myself a fitness
136:13
person at all i just
136:15
do to do it
136:25
wait what
136:30
yeah like i
136:34
i just started running one day and
136:40
i just started running one day and
136:53
i don't do very intense stuff i i
136:55
literally just i run that's it
137:02
why are you running why are you running
137:04
you need that motivation hey you got it
137:07
listen
137:09
all right
137:10
you'll start getting motivated as soon
137:12
as you start doing it you'll feel good
137:19
oh don't do it every day though
137:21
i wouldn't recommend doing it every day
137:23
i think like every two three days is
137:26
good enough
137:32
i think it's my mom
137:33
my mom kind of
137:38
my mom like
137:40
so the reason why i did start like
137:42
running
137:44
i took running very seriously when i was
137:47
uh
137:48
in high school
137:50
or like
137:51
elementary school
137:53
because that one time
137:59
one time i
138:03
i'll tell you the story okay so
138:07
i
138:09
i don't know how old was i
138:11
like
138:13
11 12 years old
138:15
and i was accidentally like
138:17
i accidentally well i didn't
138:19
accidentally join it
138:21
there was a school
138:22
like carnival athletics race right
138:26
and i was put into this age group
138:28
and i've never raced anyone in my life
138:32
probably as a as a as a very young kid
138:35
you probably you know just do it
138:38
with
138:39
your friends
138:40
but this was a legit race
138:43
[Music]
138:46
so what happened was
138:50
i
138:51
i was put into this like all of the
138:53
other guys were like a year older than
138:55
me so they were a lot bigger than me
138:59
but
139:00
i came second to last in that race
139:03
i came second to last night race
139:05
and
139:06
i'm like oh
139:07
not bad
139:09
not bad
139:11
and then a year passed
139:13
you know i was like 13 years old
139:15
i
139:18
i i joined the
139:25
i joined the uh the the school athletics
139:27
carnival again
139:28
and i was put into the same age group
139:32
and
139:35
little
139:36
i and what happened was i actually like
139:38
won
139:43
the the the guys that beat me last year
139:46
i
139:50
actually beat
139:52
and i was really surprised because one i
139:54
never
139:55
i never trained for it
139:58
i never did anything to it i just lived
140:00
my life joined the race and won it
140:04
so
140:07
like it wasn't like record breaking
140:09
anything
140:10
like that at all it was just uh
140:12
yeah
140:14
it was
140:16
it was fast so
140:19
my mom was watching and
140:22
i literally went up to her at the end of
140:24
the
140:26
like the day
140:28
and was like please you know
140:31
train me because she's
140:33
she actually was a very fast runner as
140:35
well when she
140:37
she was very young so i
140:39
i asked her
140:41
actually train me
140:49
so
140:51
yeah i did that a lot in high school
140:56
like very very young
141:01
like early like first year of high
141:03
school
141:04
i i joined the uh track team and
141:09
was it high school i don't think it was
141:14
but i was yeah i was i was young
141:17
definitely
141:22
yeah i joined
141:24
i've said that i've i've said this um
141:27
oh god sorry if i'm saying i'm alive
141:29
i've said the story a lot already well i
141:32
said this before
141:33
but
141:35
i joined the track team and i would
141:37
always like
141:39
would sometimes wake up at like six five
141:41
six a.m
141:43
and
141:46
go to like the uh
141:49
school oval
141:51
and run around
141:57
and
142:00
mama can i share also pog
142:05
and so i would just
142:07
i took it very seriously in high school
142:09
and
142:12
you know it was
142:13
it was okay
142:14
this pog
142:18
this is like the story with your rival
142:20
lol yeah people
142:23
when i talked about it last time people
142:24
were like oh homer's rival i'm like what
142:28
and it's i saw i saw the clip and it was
142:31
scary
142:32
it's scary
142:34
similar
142:44
it was scary similar
142:47
i was like what the is this
143:00
[Music]
143:06
but yeah i think i think i should stop
143:07
like the story there because i'm
143:11
you know
143:19
it scared me too i didn't expect it to
143:20
be that familiar
143:22
well yeah i i i didn't know
143:24
but
143:25
who knows
143:29
it was such a coincidence it actually
143:32
really
143:32
surprised me when i saw it
143:41
wait what that why did i say that again
143:44
why did i say that story again
143:47
oh yeah okay okay so
143:49
