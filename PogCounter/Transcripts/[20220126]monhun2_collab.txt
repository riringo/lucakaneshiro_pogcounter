you don't like it

103:50
because it seems a bit easier to use in

this game
103:56
okay
103:57
oh and you know kinsec
103:59
yeah
104:00

worlds
104:09
that's what people have told me yeah
104:11
yeah and so i was like wow this is
104:13
actually not bad
104:15
in the world it was so difficult

222:43

a really really i love this game so me
223:32
too
223:33
it's definitely a lot more fun playing
223:35
with
223:37
people and friends yeah i don't like
223:40
playing by myself either so no well i
223:42
was when i was playing by myself it
223:44
literally took me
223:46
like 40 minutes to 15 minutes to kill
223:48
monsters
223:49
you know hunting them
223:51
by the way you just need to upgrade your
223:53
stuff
223:56
i think i'm fine on my own i think you
223:58
need help though
224:00
what
224:04
yeah
224:05
i think you need a little bit of help
224:07
and a little bit of training and then i
224:09
think you can do it
224:12
once you get everything down oh is that
224:15
so finance
224:17
you didn't even know what the buddy
224:18
plaza was no i didn't i didn't
224:21
i didn't even know what a why a bug
224:23
attack is
224:25
yeah you learned i didn't know anything
224:27
i actually didn't know anything i am a
224:29
noob
224:31
exactly
224:34
see he's finally realizing it thank you
224:36
fish someone said
224:38
[Laughter]
224:42
you're welcome
224:44
[Music]
224:46
yeah i don't ever read the tutorials
224:47
that's why
224:49
well that's the problem
224:51
no the thing is sometimes i know how
224:53
they work already though
224:55
like the
224:56
hiring that's why i skip them
225:02
but i basically skip every single
225:04
tutorial so far
225:06
[Music]
225:13
someone said if you take 40 minutes to
225:15
hunt especially in the village quest you
225:18
really need to take a hard look at your
225:20
armor
225:22
it wasn't a village quest
225:24
it was the gathering hub quests okay
225:27
i don't think it makes a difference look
225:29
what do you mean
225:32
also multiplayer is slightly harder too
225:36
yeah exactly there you go
225:38
yeah but still
225:41
wait is it is it literally two different
225:43
quest lines
225:45
like village and
225:47
village is the solo story and then the
225:50
gathering hub is the multiplayer one
225:54
i see
225:56
so basically if i if i was to do like
225:58
finish the uh the village
226:01
the village quest
226:02
i'd still be
226:04
high rank one
226:06
um i think you'll
226:09
get to like two i think but oh okay uh i
226:12
think you need to do the hub once to get
226:14
to the higher ranks
226:17
i can't remember i see
226:19
what yeah
226:22
i think i i think i'll do the hub more
226:24
and and the uh story upstream hr goes up
226:26
to
226:27
three or four
226:29
what in
226:30
the
226:31
village quest
226:35
my gosh god i'm only hr3 jesus christ
226:40
i mean you're just halfway below me so
226:42
uh i still need a grind
226:46
technically i should be higher but i
226:48
just chose to take a break take a break
226:50
three three day break
226:52
yeah
226:55
yeah like i i was i was really having a
226:57
tough time with phuket
227:00
oh
227:01
is it because of the
227:03
the poison
227:04
no it just kept running away
227:07
oh

238:03
she makes the text right like for
238:05
example a white text and she adds shadow
238:08
to it by making a darker text and it's
238:11

257:02
i'm completely fine
257:09
that as an amazon employee that happens
257:11
quite a bit as long as you're not
257:12
constantly reporting your stuff missing
257:14
most of the time they'll give you a
257:15
refund even if it's your fault the thing
257:18
is it's not amazon
257:20
it was from ebay
257:23
so i don't know if ebay does does that
257:25
you know
257:26
i have no idea
257:30
bringing augustus with me yeah of course
257:35
ebay

281:39
down there it was a whole group

282:10
on the escalators
282:13
and there was like all eight of them
282:16
they were walking towards us
282:22
yeah so
282:24
the thing is right since we were on the
282:26
balcony we were basically separated
282:30
by like a glass wall
282:31
so from the outside it looked like they
282:33
were friends
282:36
like a friend group a whole friend group
282:38
it looked like that
282:41
so
282:42
they
282:45
it would be they basically surrounded us
282:47
the five of us eight of them like seven
282:49
of them i i can't remember exactly like
282:51
how many of them they were
282:54
but this this uh this little guy this
282:57
little short guy was was the one like
282:59
trying to initiate everything
283:01
and
283:03
he was like trying to
283:05
it was it was really weird he was moving
283:07
like
283:08
the chairs around like hey what do you
283:11

283:13
it was moving it around i'm like hey
283:15
you know we don't want to start anything
283:18
not gonna lie i was scared of course i
283:21
was
283:23
of course i was scared
283:25
you know i was scared because there were
283:27
so many of them and there was a really
283:29
really big dude with them too
283:36
the thing is
283:40
uh
283:45
so so
283:46
i so you know how i had like five
283:48
friends
283:50
one of them was like really like one of
283:52
my friends is really tall
283:54
he's like
283:56
he's like six
283:58
six foot eight he's really big
284:01
really really really big
284:04
uh
284:05
another friend of mine we did karate
284:07
together and i was like oh
284:09
dude i think i think this is about it
284:12
this is it you know we're gonna have to
284:13
use it
284:17
but my other friend which was uh still
284:20
the guy that started everything that
284:22
said the comment about the guy's pants
284:24
he was still trying to spite them like
284:26
dude shut the hell up what are you doing
284:29
what are you doing
284:31
why why are you going
284:33
what do you keep going
284:40
like where do you keep going
284:44
and
284:45
uh
284:46
yeah i think that's all of us that's all
284:48
five of us and then me you had me
284:51
trying to basically like stop stop the
284:53
fight but
284:55
these guys
284:56
really just wanted to get into it
284:59
like the people that approached us
285:01
he uh
285:05
like thankfully it wasn't really
285:07
like i didn't get hurt at all
285:11
um because
285:14
uh the guy the guy that was holding near
285:16
the chair around
285:19
i stood up and he's like
285:22
i can still remember this i stood up and
285:24
he just stared at me like
285:29
and he he tried to throw the chair at me
285:31
like why why is he doing this so i just
285:33
grabbed the chair and threw it back at
285:35
them
285:36
right
285:37
we had to do something we really had to
285:39
do something
285:46
we had to do something and my my friend
285:48
like the tallest guy in my
285:50
group
285:52
stood up and they all saw him
285:55
and like the big guy also like stood up
285:57
like walked in front of them
286:00
and he really wanted to square up
286:06
he really wanted to square up
286:08
but uh
286:10
they never really fought each other like
286:12
they never really punched anyone
286:15
uh i don't know what happened afterwards
286:17
i think both of them kind of just backed
286:18
down and then two other guys tried to
286:21
run
286:22
about us
286:23
by the way we were like sitting down and
286:25
they were standing up
286:26
so we didn't have anywhere to run away
286:29
to
286:30
you know
286:31
we were we were cornered
286:36
all talk no fists
286:38
yeah two guys came and actually started
286:40
to to kind of hit us
286:43
and
286:44
my friend that was kind of spiding them
286:46
up
286:47
was was the one that
286:49
you know tried to actually
286:52
you know
286:54
i had to step in because
286:57
it was a 2v1
287:01
i again i never really punched anyone i
287:03
i just had to push them away
287:06
i don't know why they
287:08
i still wonder i still wonder until this
287:10
day like why they never attacked at once
287:12
but they all came at us like one by one
287:14
or two by two it was really weird
287:21
and we all stood up at the end
287:23
and
287:25
my friend like the smart guy
287:28
the one that did karate with me was like
287:30
you know
287:31
okay
287:32
you guys there's a camera right there
287:35
right there and over there
287:37
you start anything again you're all
287:40
you're all
287:42
and they basically backed away
287:53
and the thing is there wasn't anything
287:55
there
287:56
there was there was nothing there
287:59
there was really nothing there but these
288:01
idiots actually believed him
288:16
yeah he bluffed and it worked
288:20
uh the short guy that actually threw the
288:22
chair at me
288:24
the one i threw the chair back at
288:27
he's like oh
288:28
oh oh guys sorry about that you
288:30

288:47
one you couldn't tell that
288:50
the thing is it was like a big
288:52
it was surrounding us you couldn't see
288:54
anything
288:56
it looked like friends hanging out like
288:59
a big group of friends
289:07
if you had to square up would you win i
289:09
don't know
289:10
it was so many of them like we probably
289:12
would have lost that
289:22
yeah i we
289:24
that was like uh
289:26
one of the memorable ones i've actually
289:28
i can actually remember
289:33
the smaller the person the bigger the
289:34
hate yeah this guy was really ferocious
289:37
he was just really
289:39
like angry i don't know why
289:41
i don't know why
289:43
he was just grabbing the chair the
289:44
