133:02
success you did not have to clean the

133:08

133:10
jeans back up without even
133:12
trying to tuck your your dick back into
133:14
your pants
133:16
and then went back to the stream
133:21
i'm sorry to break it to you reimu but
133:23

133:45
okay okay
133:47
i'm sorry
133:48

133:50
don't don't don't you clean it after you
133:53
pee
133:54
did you clean it no
133:56
yeah
133:57
i mean occasionally yes you should
134:00
when you
134:02
you asked
134:04
you asked what's wrong with you actually
134:07
you know what you said what did you
134:08
expect what did you expect raymond
134:19
[Music]
134:21
but occasionally you have to give it a
134:23
little dab with some with some toilet
134:25
paper
134:26
oh okay
134:28
yeah it's a dab every time right
134:31
not every time you have to do it every
134:32
time
134:35
what did you expect reimu
134:37
like us to just go to like a
134:40
a sink
134:41
and then clean it yeah
134:43
you really really seriously don't have
134:45
to do it every time you should every
134:47
time you go to test you should check
134:49
you should you should check
134:51
you should check oh yeah because how
134:54
else would you do it how else would you
134:55
do it when there's a little bit of oh
134:57
god listen listen raymond raymond
135:01
when i describe this to you have to not
135:03
scream because this is what you're
135:04
asking about but when there's a bit of
135:06
residual piss at the end of your dick
135:08
you need to just give it a little pat to
135:10
get rid of it and then you throw the
135:11
toilet paper away
135:15
this is just how it works i'm sorry ramu
135:17
you did ask
135:25
wait guys
135:27
don't tell guys in the chat okay
135:29
there is no way
135:31
you actually just
135:34
clean it like after you you do not you
135:38
listen right chat you do not have to
135:41
clean it every single time after you
135:44
piss because most of the time
135:46
yes that's right the p comes out and
135:48
then once once it's out it's gone unless
135:52
it like drips unless it unless it rains
135:55
rainbow unless don't vomit reimu raimu
135:58
don't vomit unless it wait for it drips
136:01
a little bit you don't have to clean it
136:05
when it comes out so you gotta clean it
136:06
right
136:07
congrats
136:09
but also it's been inside you the entire
136:11
time so when it exits you it's
136:13
completely clean
136:15
so
136:16
if it's left on you that's when you
136:19
clean it right you're the one asking
136:21
these questions i'm only trying to help
136:23
and only you're i'm only asking you at
136:26
the bare minimum clean after you pee
136:31
you clean when you have to after you pee
136:34
it's not 100 necessary every single time
136:37
it's clean because bacteria
136:40
no
136:41
if there's bits left you clean it but
136:44
not always it doesn't always happen
136:46
[Music]
136:50
oh someone just said by that
136:53
by that logic
136:56
when you take a dump
136:57
is it
136:59
it's it's kind of the same thing well no
137:01
no no no a completely different thing
137:02
you always write
137:04
you have to always wipe obviously you
137:06
always wipe
137:07
you're not even wiping you need a bidet
137:10
to like clean it and you don't need a
137:12
bidet oh go on oh go on you don't need a
137:16
good day what is this conversation you
137:19
need you need you need just
137:22
you need just you need just one or two
137:24
sheets of toilet paper to just do the
137:27
job and leave it it's
137:29
fine
137:30
you should use a bidet occasionally when
137:33
you need to
137:34
but every single time
137:39
you'd probably be remarkably clean but
137:41
you also don't need to do that it's fine
137:44
need to remind you the vast majority of
137:46
households do not have a bidet do you
137:48
mean to suggest that 99 of the earth's
137:51
population have a stanky ass
137:53

137:56

into the machinery
143:12
this is way too much stuff yeah you're
143:15

145:27
parasol in the desert as it happens it's
145:30
imperative to your survival what is
145:33
ridiculous the shade will hurt much less
145:36

145:58
dude how do you open the door
146:04
this box yeah vox is still here
146:07
hello
146:08
i apologize for my impromptu
146:10
my impromptu ass wiping talk
146:15
i just think rainbow is being quite
146:17
silly
146:18
chat you agree with me right you need to
146:20
be you need to be sort of pragmatic
146:22
about the nature of cleaning your your
146:24
private areas and if it does not need to
146:26
be clean
146:28
in the moment then you're fine but you
146:30
should also check and make sure that it
146:32
doesn't need to and if it does need to
146:33
then you should clean it but if you
146:35
don't need to then you don't have to
146:36
right
146:41
box you're lucky i'm a simp
146:46
no you should always always always
146:48
always always wipe your ass but taking a
146:51
piss is fine
146:55
always of course i'm saying you should
146:56
always wash your hands that wasn't even
146:58
part of the debate yes if you take a
147:00
[ __ ]
147:01
wash your wipe your ass and wash your
147:03
hands if you take a piss wash your hands
147:06
right was i giving the impression that
147:08
you shouldn't wash your hands holy [ __ ]
147:10
i'm sorry i was given the impression
147:12
that you don't always need to dab the
147:13
ticket the tip of your dick with a piece
147:15
of toilet paper
147:17
that's all
147:19
you should always wash your hands
147:26
this whole thing was because luca
147:28
doesn't i do
147:30
he does wash his hands he was just a
147:32
complete legend about it and managed to
147:34
manage to piss
147:35
completely freehand
147:38
like you know
147:39
like someone
147:40
built like a fridge would manage to he
147:43
just sort of opened himself to the
147:44
elements and pissed and it all worked
147:46
out exactly dude
147:48
yeah again like
147:52
why do you need to
147:54
if you don't have to
147:56
right huh
148:00
okay i'm back oh
148:02
yeah we're just trying to uh
148:04
talk about how lovely this is
148:07
let me ask you a question were you under
148:09
the impression
148:10
that when i mentioned the whole [ __ ]
148:11
about being conservative about when you
148:14
do or do not
148:15
clean yourself after you take a [ __ ]
148:16
were you under the impression that i
148:17
said you shouldn't wash your hands
148:20
you don't have to wash your hands every
148:21
time
148:22
i mean talk about washing your hands so
148:26
so i'd like to clarify i meant
148:28
that you should always wash your hands
148:30
it's just when you take a piss you don't
148:32
always have to dab the tip of your dick
148:34
with toilet paper
148:36
[Music]
148:38
i just want to make sure that no one's
148:39
getting out there with false information
148:41
okay
148:45
wait
148:47
you you can if you need to but it's not
148:49
always necessary anyway moving on daniel
148:51
daniel what what still having nightmares
148:54
i see
148:55
yes
148:57
i know you guys get it but i wanted to
148:59
clarify for reimu because she's going to
149:00
bully me and think i'm gross
149:03
you are gross that is not going to
149:05
change even if you tell me you wash your
149:07
hands yeah well you're dead
149:09
[Laughter]
149:12
okay but i'm clean i'm a clean soul nah
149:16
your real body is probably like probably
149:18
your real body's like underground and
149:19

149:25
probably full of like full of like worms
149:27
and insects and [ __ ] like you're gross
149:29
come on
149:33
i'm a demon i'm a demon who practices
149:36
i don't have poop in my butt i always
149:38
wipe
149:39
i always wipe my hands
149:42
my ass is [ __ ] immaculate
149:47
if you're that concerned you're welcome
149:48
to take a look but you'll be sorely
149:50
disappointed
149:51
[Music]
149:53
i thought i did not want to look at
149:55
anyone's butt well then why are you so
149:57
concerned about the state of my ass
150:00
leave me alone
150:05

150:06
my ass is fine my ass is very clean
150:11
oh my god guys
150:13
i'm sorry look up this is not even my
150:16
fault you know everything is always box
150:18
[Laughter]
150:20
i disagree
150:22
i disagree this was that we actually got
150:23
into this this conversation because
150:25
someone because i remember who it was
150:26
but somebody brought up luca being able
150:28
to piss freehand which i thought was
150:30
quite
150:30
hilarious ew yeah it's kind of parked
150:33
though wait how
150:35
the way he just kind of he just kind of
150:37
unzipped and went for it i didn't need
150:38
to wash his hands because he never
150:40
touched his dick not a single time
150:44
i did not understand the physics of that
150:47
don't you have to be like well it just
150:49
it just it it's it's it's it's like a
150:51
water spout
150:53
guys i think i think we should stop this
150:55
conversation
151:00
when you piss there's a lot of force but
151:02
then gravity draws it towards the toilet
151:04
bowl and you just don't have to think
151:06
about it if you know you just know okay
151:21
why do you keep laughing
151:23
cause it's funny
151:28

151:29

i just have to note that there are only
161:34
two spare rods left in the storage in

herbert's address book and received
161:58
answers of varying importance
162:01
today is second order greatly from the
162:04
others
162:05
from a baron in prussia

okay
165:07
three three five one two four
165:10
okay
165:11
let's
165:12
structure for this one
165:15
by the way it's not the engine that
165:16
powers the elevator
165:18
north
165:20
machine equipment momentum
165:24
instructions
165:26
okay if the elevator breaks down again
165:28
make sure to use the steam engine to
165:30
build up pressure before channeling it
165:32
into the machinery
165:33
adjust the levers
165:35
to uh to get the right amount of
165:37
pressure inside the chamber the meter
165:39
should be it should read
165:41
up eight and down eight
165:45
make sure the flow is set according to
165:46
the following chant
165:49
trinity eight
165:51
so
165:52
and what the hell is this
166:01
what hold on okay i got this
166:05
i got this
166:07
you got it
166:10
up eight down eight
166:13
yeah as i got this ready
166:18
watch
166:26
huh
166:30
check it out
166:36
check it out it's okay it's okay let him
166:39
let him eddie boom
166:42
gaming oh [ __ ]
166:44
not enough
166:49
i thought i was gonna get lucky
166:52
look at there are numbers
166:54
there are numbers and you cannot brute
166:56
force
166:57
math
167:01
wait up eight down hey what does that
167:02
even mean though yeah but there are
167:05
numbers
167:07
yeah this is three it means
167:09
let's wait a little bit
167:12
up eight
167:15
six
167:17
one five six five two two
167:24
up eight down eight
167:27
up eight down eight okay i got this
167:29
don't tell me
167:30
up eight i won't it's okay
167:34
oh
167:36
yeah
167:38
up eight down eight
167:40
wait hold on
167:43
okay
167:45
box are you good with
167:46
math i i have been known to dabble what
167:49
is what is the puzzle
167:52
down eight
167:54
up eight
167:56
down eight
167:57
it down eight up eight
167:59
i got this
168:00
guys up eights
168:03
okay
168:04
so
168:06
is it like edition so
168:10
i i don't know i don't see any pens yet
168:14
honestly like
168:16
any patterns here up eight and down
168:19
eight okay so if you want up eight just
168:21
yeah that one that one up and then the
168:24
one up and then the four up and then
168:26
turn the rest of them down
168:30
so the second one second lever down
168:33
i love how luca is laughing like i
168:35
didn't get [ __ ]
168:38
hold on let me figure it out let me
168:40
figure it out okay i got this i got it i
168:42
got it
168:43
that's not going to work that's not
168:45
going to work that's not going to work
168:50
we've got to turn down for some [ __ ]
168:51
i'm trying to see what the numbers even
168:53
mean
168:55
they're numbers
168:58
yes oh you mean up eight down eight yeah
169:00
like
169:01
the [ __ ] is that yeah
169:03
it's just like
169:04
is it eight on one two three and then uh
169:07
down eight on
169:08
three uh
169:11
four five six
169:12
okay
169:14
i did not understand what you just said
169:16
up eight do you know what up it is
169:19
yeah up ate my ass
169:22
[ __ ] you
169:23
i'm not helping you i'm not helping in
169:25
this one good luck figuring this one out
169:28
good luck figuring this one out you can
169:31
ask the demon
169:33
for help if you want to ah
169:36
you come you you you come to me for help
169:41
what do you ask of me
169:46
up eight down eight
169:48
what the [ __ ] does that have two options
169:50
the one that clears so you're gonna have
169:52
it i would assume it needs to add up to
169:54
eight
169:56
that's that's so that's what i was
169:57
thinking like uh
169:59
it used to add up to eight on both sides
170:01
right so that's what i was thinking um
170:04
you have three three five
170:07
one which is twelve and then two
170:10
oh go to the right that's four
170:13
uh uh three three
170:16
six eleven
170:18
plus two is thirteen plus four is 17 so
170:21
it's 17 total on top and then the [ __ ]
170:24
are you doing i don't know
170:27
i tried 6 12
170:29
12
170:31
17 and then
170:33
17 21 21 on the bottom uh
170:38
i'm just trying to figure out what are
170:39
you talking about
170:41
leave leave me leave me alone
170:44
deadpool i'm figuring out what are you
170:45
talking about
170:49
i'm i'm
170:50
i'm i'm just i'm just i'm just putting
170:52
i'm just landscaping the maps
170:54
right now okay
170:57
i've had a few i've had a few i've had
170:58
i've i've
171:00
it's new year's i've had a few pints
171:01
this evening right i'm just trying to
171:02
get i'm just trying to emerge through
171:04
the through
171:07
i i just have to see it i i have to
171:10
i have to figure it out
171:12
you know
171:13
i just have to i won't forgive myself if
171:15
if i don't figure this out
171:19
right let's get the right amount of
171:20
pressure inside the chamber but the
171:21
meanest should read
171:23
down eight
171:26
up eight i'm in hell
171:28
no it's fine
171:30
well
171:39
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
171:41
wait
171:42
they just have to add up to plus eight
171:44
okay so just okay start with the top
171:47
right stomach
171:49
the thing is this one can't add up to
171:50
eight at all
171:53
three
171:54
boom three plus three okay you know adds
171:56
up to eight luca three plus three plus
171:58
two so put all the levers down except
172:00
for the ones that say three three and
172:02
two
172:03
so three three two
172:05
third one third one no no no just start
172:07
with this start here that one down
172:10
down that one down
172:13
right so we're slightly off but on top
172:15
it reads eight and on bottom it reads
172:18
what's it what's it called um
172:22
right
172:23
so
172:26
now what huh right and what i'm saying
172:29
luka is we got to figure it out i think
172:31
the best way to do it
172:35
oh you know do you know what luca do you
172:37
know what
172:38
[Music]
172:41
your penis um

172:45
that one on the bottom if you wait if
172:47
you go back to the body go wait wait
172:48
wait wait wait go back to the fourth
172:49
down eight
172:52
that's that's that's that's five
172:55
we hold on
172:58

yeah no she's right luke i'm sorry
173:39
hold on wait
173:41

173:43
rare circumstances in which you've
173:45
actually been right i'm always right
173:47
shut the [ __ ] up like you are brain dead
173:49
right now you do not want to fight me me
173:51
and luca are just two simple men from
173:54
the past when to be honest when we were
173:55
taught maths it probably worked a lot
173:57
differently how you you were taught it
173:59
so
174:00
that's why your last against
174:03
because we're stupid as what
174:05
yeah look listen listen like no that was
174:08
about that was pure numbers that was a
174:09
pure numbers battle right i actually i
174:12
actually have people on my side
174:15
yeah well done though see we actually
174:17
had people on my side who are better at
174:18
trigonometry in order to sort like the
174:20
catapults and stuff
174:22
but um he just had more people so like
174:24
you know they just kind of flooded in
174:25
yeah this is kind of the way it works
174:27
and people who came from the sea proud
174:29
of you ignored this demo i'm so proud of
174:31
you
174:32
you asked me a question raymond raymond
174:34
you asked me a question and i was
174:36
answering it wait it needs more work
174:40
wait what the hell
174:42
that's not bad
174:44
no you have more stuff in your inventory

no
175:49

[Music]
177:35
i'm traveling
177:37
okay
177:39
so make sure the flow is set according
177:41
to the following chance trinity steam
177:43
set functions for face amplitude
177:47
complete steam flow cycle okay there's
177:50
something to do here i just don't know
177:52
what it is
177:53
oh
177:54
there's nothing in the fire for

179:43
okay you read the instructions
179:49
oh my god the fireworks
179:54
the oil is going to run out yep i need
179:56
to stop using it
179:58
okay
180:01
adjust the lever we've done that make
180:02
sure the flow is set according to the
180:04
following done that
180:06
trinity steam set function
180:08
for phase amplitude doesn't even see
180:11
anything
180:12
where the [ __ ] you have to do maths in
180:14
this horror game man what the [ __ ] i
180:16
just want to get scared
180:19
guys this game is great
180:22
just just need to think for a little bit
180:25
it's not it's not that bad i promise
180:32
me and luca don't know how to think i
180:34
probably have to uh go back up
180:36
let's see
180:39
remember go look back at the math
180:41
instructions
180:43
remember there was a sheet and it was
180:45
like super long and it happens
180:47
instructions isn't it yeah the math
180:50
instructions remember the the memo
180:52
that had like up down
180:54
yeah
180:55
that's it though
180:57
keep on reading it
180:59
that is that is instruction for the
181:01
elevator
181:02
trinity steam set functions
181:06
or phase amplitude
181:10
complete steam flow cycle
181:13
note that the machine will not check
181:14
proper configuration until all rods are
181:16
inserted yeah but that's what i was
181:18
looking for right now like where can i
181:20
put this
181:21
the joy cycle
181:23
ah maybe this one
181:25
oh there we go
181:27
why do you only have one
181:29
picked up
181:30
fluid cycle rod
181:33
wait i need three of these
181:35
yeah
181:38
yeah
181:39
what the [ __ ] where are they then
181:41
oh i don't know explore around i don't
181:43

206:39
uh if it doesn't i'm so sorry for your
206:41
loss
206:42
i thought it already saves
206:46
i the thing is i don't know if it auto
206:48
saves i don't remember that
206:50
i'm on normal mode right now
206:53
does it save let me go i don't want you
206:55
like
206:56
exiting the game thinking it auto saves
206:58
and then you come back with like nothing
207:04
please save your game don't do the same
207:05
mistakes again
207:07
no
207:08
oh
207:10
it does all the same right
207:14
but it says
207:16
in heart mode
207:18
you have limited saves and auto states
207:20
are disabled so
207:21
i i think that that is like
207:24
loki saying
207:26
in normal mode it auto saves right why
207:28
is this guy so faster why
207:33
how can he reach me so fast
207:35
you got it right and you you were
207:37
running with your light

208:02
i mean i can't do anything right
208:04
no you cannot stop
208:19
the thing is what if he saves an exit
208:21
and then when he loads back in he's
208:22
gonna be stuck forever
208:26
i'm scared
208:28
exit normally so it's like normal okay i
208:31
guess you have auto saves in normal mode
208:35
any unsafe progress will be lost

357:55
happy new year
357:57
luca it's been a year since i've been

358:20
three administer the torture in any way
358:23
you like but the forte of the wheel
358:26

358:27
this in the video that the victim shall
358:29
die
358:30
basically
358:31
this one
358:32
i think um
358:34
between the frame like
358:37
let's hide there like defeat
358:40
and the hands tied then you basically
358:42
spin them until
358:44
they get stretched
358:45
stretched
358:49
it stretched you out
358:52
until you go all the way around
358:55
yeah
358:57
that's how that one works
359:06
yeah because i saw it in the video guys
359:10
top 10 torture devices of all like in
359:12

um
427:32
was
427:35
yeah the
427:36
the guy that i've been seeing the entire
427:38
time flashbacks yeah
427:41
yeah yeah
427:43
and i was reliving it because i was i
427:45
was i was turning into him like that
427:49
[Music]
427:51
oh my god well what was it then
427:56
uh so
427:59
daniel went to an exploration in some
428:02
weird desert some weird country and they
428:06
found the orb
428:07
but when they took it they took the
428:09
shadow with them
428:11
i'm talking about daniel
428:13
there were some notes talking about some
428:14
expedition right okay so so he went back
428:17
to put the put the all back
428:20
no he took it back to england oh cause
428:23
they're english people
428:26
uh
428:26
so he took the orb he took the ordinance
428:30
yeah chad i was like expecting him to
428:32
like ask me who's in you
428:35
i don't know who daniel is that knows me
428:37
right
428:38
yeah he took back the whole the orb
428:41
uh and since he noticed he was being
428:43
chased by
428:44
uh
428:45
the shadow
428:46
he went i mean alexander reached out to
428:49
him like oh i can help you you you
428:51
follow me and you're gonna escape from
428:53
this you're gonna be fine i'll protect
428:55
you he was like yeah finally my savior
428:58
so alexander kind of tricked him
429:01
into like torturing people torturing
429:03
innocent people
429:04
believing that would
429:07
them
429:09
yeah wait i was torturing people
429:11
yeah you were torturing people you were
429:14
an [ __ ]
429:15
yeah you were torturing like and
429:17
kidnapping children and kidnapping
429:19
families and you were torturing them
429:20
because alexander
429:23
thought
429:24
that people spain
429:26
would like give him a sort of energy to
429:29
like
429:30
use the orb to go back home or like open
429:32
the portal to go back home
429:35
so at some point alexander betrayed you
429:39
it was like now [ __ ] you
429:41
and that's when where's heart stuff
429:45
i don't know nobody knows okay all right
429:47
please but don't know
429:49
okay so you get pissed off and then you
429:51
drink the umbrella
429:53
and that's when the game starts
429:55
alexander was the uh the
429:58
the naked guy right
430:00
yeah the blue guy he was
