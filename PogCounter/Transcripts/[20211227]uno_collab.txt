three games in a row well not in a row
105:40
just three games and
105:42
then you get to have a big punishment
105:44
for the losing team
105:46
or is that too much thinking would you
105:48
prefer like a big punishment
105:50
yeah we could do big ones so it's not
105:51
live free time
105:53
yeah
105:54
yeah i think you know because 200 i
105:56
think it takes like four games
106:00
but when you're playing doubles it goes
106:01
quickly
106:03
does it it depends on how many cards the
106:05
other team has left i think
106:07
it's taking the game
106:09
yeah yeah i'm gonna invite you because i
106:11
have all of you let's just do let's just
106:13
do singles and then the winning team
106:16
picks one person in the losing team okay
