the thing is chad like whenever i read a
184:08
book
184:09
i really just don't know what's
184:10
happening
184:12
i i i've talked to so many people about
184:14
it too they're like oh well we got like
184:16
a
184:18
picture in our head we can visualize it
184:21
i i don't see that at all i don't see
184:24
that
184:26
i've never once seen it
184:32
why do you think i was really a picture
184:33
book in high school and a girl came up
184:35
to me and started reading with me
184:37
a picture book chat
184:50
a picture bucket
184:59
to read your picture
185:09
yeah like
185:11
as i can you know i can read i read the
185:13
entire of doki doki literature club
185:17
but sometimes
185:19
if i'm really not enjoying myself i just
185:22
won't understand it
185:24
read mangaluca i have i
185:27
that works better for me
185:33
[Music]
185:39
it's okay our brain process things
185:41
differently
185:46
and the thing is like i told my teachers
185:48
in high school about that like i
185:50
[Music]
185:53
i really just don't understand what's
185:55
going on
185:56
and and they still pick me to like tell
185:58
them oh
186:01
you know and page 276
186:04
this man was walking down the street
186:06
with with a bunch of friends while a car
186:09
goes up to them and throws trash at them
186:13
what do you think the car did
186:15
can you explain what the car is doing at
186:17
that time
186:25
the
186:26
car the car
186:32
the
186:40
car i mean that's that's usually how
186:43
english literature is right
186:46
they ask you things like that
186:48
oh
186:50
12 12 09 a.m
186:53
midnight
186:56
you you turn on the lights
186:58
but the lights don't turn on
187:00
why
187:02
why do you think that
187:08
what does the flickering symbolize
187:15
why was the door red luca
187:22
aren't i true though sorry wasn't that
187:24
isn't that true
187:34
and by the way english like language is
187:37
different
187:38
the english literature okay
187:40
i'm not saying the english language is
187:42
bad whatsoever
187:44
it's english literature
187:50
[Music]
187:57
like why the gingerbread man
187:59
why was the gingerbread man running away
188:02
from the big bad wolf
188:06
if the big bad wolf was about to eat
188:08
them why was it running away
188:12
yeah it's running away from being eaten
188:14
but why though but why
188:26
you know what i mean
188:29
it's exactly like that
188:34
he doesn't want to die
188:36
you know he doesn't want to get eaten he
188:38
doesn't want to get digested but why
188:40
doesn't he why does he not want to be
188:42
eaten
188:51
but why though
188:54
can you explain
189:05
[Music]
189:06
and then you have like a
189:08
and when it's on to time
189:10
[Music]
189:12
like oh it's because
189:14
i don't even know dude i don't even know
189:20
and then you get like the the most
189:23
random answer
189:25
that you probably would never have
189:26
thought of
189:33
oh it's because the grass was actually
189:35
you know very fertilized that day uh
189:37
that's why
189:39
that's why the wolf didn't want to eat
189:41
grass
189:42
it was going for the gingerbread
189:43
gingerbread man instead
189:49
[Laughter]
