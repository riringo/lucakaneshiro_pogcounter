147:11
yeah
147:13
really
147:14
yeah
147:15
why do you want to do that
147:18
i'm just thinking about what you would
147:20
do
147:21
okay
147:23
why do you want to do that
147:25
okay okay so one two
147:28
and two why
147:31
one two three
147:35
okay i think i need to bring this out
147:37
actually
147:38
what is this formation even
147:44
i know what you're gonna do next
147:48
i'm trying to think put her here
147:55
trying to think right now oh my god leia
147:58
think of the aqua super my goodness if i
148:00
do
148:07
i do this
148:09
that puts you there but then you can get
148:10
rid of it with the queen
148:12
yeah my queen
148:14
my queen
148:17
so maybe i shouldn't do that yet
148:19
michael then
148:20
i should try to threaten the queen
148:23
somehow
148:26
so what i should do
148:28
is you move the horsey
148:30
yeah rubex
148:32
but then if i move it
148:33
i'm gonna get it here and you're gonna
148:35
get it

148:59
little bit of an oofer huh
149:02
oh but then
149:03
it's a little bit of an oof that maybe
149:05
is worth it because then
149:07
that's oh actually you know what i think
149:09
this is oh [ __ ] oh yeah
149:11

181:02

181:08

181:15
oh triple three
181:17
i mean one triple
181:19
triple one
181:21
oh another one
181:22
last one
181:24
all right you know what i'm just gonna
181:25
see if i can hit the triple 20.
181:28
i think if i do it like this
181:31
oh 20.
181:32
only 20 only 20.
181:36
like this
181:38
i love dots oh my god i love dots so
181:41
much i love dots mister oh my god
181:44
oh my god
181:45
i love dots
181:48
i love dogs
181:53
i love dogs
181:58
oh my god
182:00
i actually lost that
182:02
like
182:03
by a lot if we do dots again we can do
182:05
the other one that's like the actual
182:06
game
182:07
three isn't the actual game yeah
182:11
okay
182:12
so this one you have to like
182:14
keep getting numbers right and then when
182:16
the number gets low enough you need to
182:17
hit that number
182:20
you'll see it won't you'll see so we
182:22
start with 301 and every time you hit
182:25
like a dart it will minus that from 301
182:29
so the first one to get to one what wins
182:34
yeah yeah
182:35
okay
182:37
pretty much like that
182:39
20. nice not bad okay not bad

i've been really wanting to collab with

him for a while now

but
216:03
i don't know like the reason why it's
216:05
been like kind of
216:06
late
216:08
is because we've already basically hung
216:10
out a lot of stream
216:13
like before we debuted i i figured it
216:15
would be better to collab with people
216:17
first and then
216:19
collab afterwards you know
216:27
look at how tall are you
216:29

ebay doesn't really
220:03
like it automatically puts in
220:07
um an address so i forgot to kind of
220:09
change it
220:11
so i basically sent it to someone's like
220:14
house like someone's house
220:16
some random person's house and i went
220:18
there today
220:20

the pink super
229:50
i appreciate that i really do
229:55
is it national australia day tomorrow
229:57
don't you have to get up early oh my god
229:59
you're right chad
230:01
wait wait wait
230:08
once the hunter rise with phenomena
230:13
9 a.m
230:17
it's 12 a.m
230:22
oh god oh god uh
230:24
okay i i i need to get the waiting room
230:26
up
230:29
and everything too
230:31
i do have a waiting room but it doesn't
230:33
have a fina someone actually did make a
230:36
waiting room uh moogie
230:38
was that moogie
230:42
the thing is uh
230:46
when
230:47
mookie
230:48
when people make
230:50
uh thumbnails for me
230:52
like
230:53
all the time
230:54
but when i'm collabing with someone and
230:57
they have them in the same frame i'd
230:59
like that other person to use that
231:01
instead of me
231:03
because
231:04
you know i already get enough like
231:07
i guess thumbnail and
231:13
like art
231:14
especially from moogie
231:18
moogie makes my thumbnail sometimes but
231:22
yeah
231:23
like for example uh with with
231:27
with monster hunter
231:29
with banana tomorrow
231:33
i'd prefer finally use that instead of
231:35
me because
231:36
again moogie already makes so many for
231:38
me
231:39
so
231:42
