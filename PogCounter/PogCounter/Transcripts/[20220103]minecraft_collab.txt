i just don't think yeah something's eggs
33:43
that's kind of you have like caviar
33:45
sandwiches
33:47
have you ever eaten chicken
33:49
chicken eggs
33:50
i didn't think that would be chicken
33:52
eggs they're not really eggs you know
33:54
like compared to like a fish eggs oh
33:56
here he goes again what what the
33:58
chickens don't come from the eggs
34:01
mister what
34:03
mister mister there comes a mister
34:15
what was the prevailing knowledge in
34:18
1967 did you believe that chickens were
34:20
just [ __ ] out of other chickens did you
34:22
believe that eggs simply unless this and
34:24
what oh my god chicken eggs are
34:25
different to like
34:27
birthing eggs that chickens make
34:30
what
34:31
i mean technically yes but they're the
34:32
same thing one's just been fertilized
34:36
wait can you can you explain the
34:38
explain the process of how chickens is
34:41
that a female chicken a hen lays eggs
34:44
they are infertile and they are those
34:46
they are the ones that we eat whereas
34:49
when a male chicken fertilizes it it
34:51
then will grow into a light what so
34:54
males can give birth wait what no way i
34:57
don't know
34:59
oh actually uh what do you call it oh
35:02
you're you're talking about seahorses
35:04
seahorses yeah
35:05
males male chickens the male seahorses
35:07
give birth i'm sorry to break it to you
35:09
but yes male chickens can in fact i
35:11
don't like wait
35:12
did we actually do that i thought eggs
35:14
were just eggs and the old pregnancy
35:17
kink let's go we're on this we're on
35:19
this subject because of you and mr
35:20
caviar boy
35:22
yo take a look at this this is the new
35:24
stuff
35:25
that's the one that brought it elsewhere
35:28
okay fair is that not anything
35:30
i didn't mean to be mean are they
35:31
actually um
35:34
here's it's your steak right so hang on
35:36

35:57
in a minute but we're the majority oh my
36:00
god me and mister me and mister we are
36:03
at three six
36:05
three
36:06
nine nine
36:08
there you go yeah
36:11
what about no you need to get diseased
36:13
you don't need to i think i think you no
36:15
you need the z more than the y oh wait
36:17
why is the the height we're traveling
36:19
along an x axis
36:21
three six one
36:23
oops
36:24
three
36:29
oh what
36:31
all right vox i'm gonna i'm gonna go
36:33
meet them
36:34
shankar thank you for the super um
36:37
wait guys i'm i'm so confused
36:51
why do they lay eggs in the first place
36:53
um why are we talking about this i don't
36:56
i don't even think to be honest i don't
36:58
even think they do i think that i think
36:59
they just i'm not you'll have to correct
37:01
me on this i think that hens just lay
37:03
eggs and then the male chickens comb on
37:04
the eggs and that makes them into
37:06
chickens but no
37:09
people like getting like eggs from the
37:11
store
37:13
growing those into chicks
37:15
what
37:16
yeah
37:17
i mean yeah no like maybe that works
37:19
because it's technically like a
37:21
fertilized embryo that you eat so if
37:23
you've got a store-bought egg and then
37:25
you got some chicken coomb could you not
37:27
then turn it into
37:28
really about that oh mister you silly
37:31
bastard
37:32
why i don't even do anything i don't
37:34
know that when will you learn when will
37:36
you learn you didn't do it
37:38
what's happening when will you learn not
37:39
to accost tall men on the street
37:41
just just because just because you have
37:43
napoleon syndrome doesn't mean that's
37:45

me too
139:11
you said shake on that i was like oh mr
139:14
making [ __ ] well steak is one of my
139:15
favorite things to make because like
139:17
oh mike's been here the entire time it's
139:20
kind of expensive but it's also not so
139:22
expensive that you that like it's
139:24
unaffordable steak so yeah steak like
139:27
from like if you go to you know a
139:29
supermarket you can get like a really
139:30
really really really nice steak for like
139:33
three or four pounds
139:34
and then
139:35
you know and then you can and then you
139:37
can just you know as long as you prepare
139:39
it nicely
139:40
really really good
139:42
like the other day i made steak and eggs
139:43
for myself with scallions and onions and
139:46
obviously
139:55
yeah
139:56
no no okay i actually only learned this
139:58
recently so the way it works is
140:01
it's a green it's a i think it's a thing
140:04
no it's a spring onion if it has a very
140:07
large white bulb
140:08
it's a spring onion if the bulb is
140:11
slightly smaller and it's a scallion if
140:13
it's
140:14
completely you know what i'm talking
140:16
about no i guess
140:17
yeah well
140:19
i was thinking of scallop
140:21
yeah that's what i was thinking oh yeah
140:22
scallops yeah no scallions are a type of
140:25
type of root vegetable i've never been
140:26
so
140:27
what you do is when you make steak and
140:29
eggs this is a golden ramsay recipe by
140:30
the way
140:31
you start caramelizing some regular
140:33
white onions and then you add in the
140:34
whites of spring onions to sweeten up
140:36
those onions and then you also add
140:38
butter to caramelize them nicely and in
140:40
that you are cooking a steak in the
140:41
middle of it and um so after that's done
140:44
you like you put the steak out to rest
140:46
you lay the onions on your plate you cut
140:48
the steak lay that over the onions and
140:50
then you fry some eggs add a spicy rub
140:52
to the eggs and then you lay them over
140:54
the steak and it's beautiful is this
140:56
gonna be on the test
140:58
uh yes it absolutely will
141:00
oh if you don't if you can't recite that
141:03
if you can't recite that member that uh
141:05
recipe to me by memory um i'm going to
141:07
just kill you in cold blood oh no
141:09
