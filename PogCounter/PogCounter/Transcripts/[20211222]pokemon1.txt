you're really not going to do very well
138:17

138:20
make this a nice look
138:21
it is
138:36
that you imagine the pokemon wait not if

they faint but if they actually just are
138:40
killed
138:43
you guys can like make how do you kill a

138:57
delayed video so what you guys in chat
138:59

139:01
the entire gym battle transpire and then
139:04

139:05

139:11
one pokemon's at least going to die

139:19
well i mean i mean i mean thankfully
139:21

139:31
to die
139:33

139:36
pokemon speak with it like don't pokemon
139:38
speak with their names and you're right
139:40
i can't help but feel like chimchar
139:41
would just kind of break that rule
139:43
because he's a he's a monkey who's like
139:45
slightly intelligent enough to just sort
139:46
of realize that something's wrong
139:49
shoe shoe
139:50
shoe oh wait kind of breaks and breaks

140:33
bitrate but you know live and learn
140:35
mine was was it really wasn't really
140:37

i i took it
141:07
into the end
141:09
yeah i just took a break like like
141:11
around six hours in and i just thought i
141:13
was debating like i know this is a
141:14

141:15
just really don't want to do this
141:17
anymore and i was just
141:19

it
148:54
it doesn't really make much sense to do
148:56
but then when i do it and especially
148:58
when i'm around other people it tends to
149:02
elicit quite a reaction which just sort
149:03

already
158:56

159:02

all right here we go
159:08
let's go
159:10
let's go
159:12

159:16
this is the aura braga gym
159:19
i mean
159:21
brooke the gym leader
159:25
i'm but one trainer who decides to walk
159:27
proudly with rock type pokemon
159:32
wait wait they can't hear it
159:35
oh the game screen died
159:37
what happened
159:38
guys this
159:41
i am having such big scuffs today you
159:43
know
159:45
i'm sorry i think i think i i the monkey
159:48
pokemon may have just kind of broken out
159:49
and smashed the camera on my way out
159:51
it's kind of like a sign of vengeance
159:53
just just being treated like being of
159:55
being treated like an animal
159:57
game just kind of
159:59
it's bad the game just kind of up
160:00
up and went back
160:04
yep it's back it's back as a gym leader
160:07
if you actually
160:08
yeah if you dial back the footage like
160:10
minutes before the screen goes black you
160:12
can see one frame of vox the the monkey
160:15
just like just with his face completely
160:17
pressed up against the lens of the
160:19
camera and then it cuts one frame
160:23
when it went black i
160:25
i wonder how many people got that thing
160:27
you know when you're playing
160:29
playing on your switch and you go to a
160:31
loading screen the screen goes
160:32
completely black so you just see
160:33
yourself stay
160:35
staring back
160:42
all right
160:43
well
160:44
i think it's good now
160:47
let's begin
160:48
i'll need to see the toughness of the
160:50
pokemon at battle with you
160:56

let's go
163:23
nice
163:26
the gamers okay shoot do you want to
163:29
learn double team
163:32
is that a good move
163:33
oh it's better than ground
163:35
better than growl
163:38
so
163:38
double teams and they're not gonna land
163:40
a single blow
163:41
heck yeah
163:44

163:49
mack punch
163:51

164:23
down the next pokemon like the others
164:28
but be careful right now now that the
164:30
monkey is becoming more more powerful if
164:31
you give him too much attention he may
164:33
convert that into stress and just go
164:35
completely wild and start hitting people
164:38
oh oh
164:40
he's got to be really careful you know
164:41
but it could be fine it should be fine

mork did that
177:17
okay sure
177:21
all right well at least uh we have a we
177:23
have someone alive
177:24
in the in the run the run wasn't over
177:26
yeah that's what matters
177:28
yeah the run
177:29
run was saved there was
177:31
there was exactly one
177:34
one
177:35
milligram of monkey left after that
177:37
vicious battle that we have to
177:38
resuscitate him by any means necessary
177:42
i like how you use milligrams as a unit
177:44
of measurement
177:46
there
177:48
is there's about three liters of mung of
177:51
liquidated monkey left in this jar and
177:53
if we use enough lightning we might be
177:55
able to bring him back
177:56
[Music]
177:58
oh my god
178:00
i remember the first time i used i
178:02
used i described something as a deci
178:05
leader and everybody was just like what
178:07
are you talking about what the hell is
178:09
that what what is that what is it
178:10
who 10 liters
178:13
you know how it's like milliliters
178:14
centiliters deciliters and then a liter
178:16
what i just know it works i just have
178:20
millimeters
178:21
yeah yeah yeah yeah
178:23
should we get that's one tenth
178:25
one tenth of a liter one tenth of a
178:26
liter
178:29
deciliter a milliliter is a one thousand
178:32
yes yeah yeah yeah
178:34
yeah like
178:35
how many million is
178:38
what
178:40
oh this [ __ ] just hit me from
178:46
one 10 to the 10 to the whatever
178:49
i just thought of a really bad joke
178:54
yeah what is that
178:56
one of our senpai does that mean that
178:58
her her height is a milliliter no
179:01
milliliter millimeter [ __ ] i [ __ ] up
179:03
my own joke someone
179:05
someone just said desolator
179:08
desolator i hardly even know her
179:11
hey guys can i tell you something
179:14
can i tell you something
179:15
this is something i sure i've kept to
179:17
myself for the past
179:20
like let's say yeah for the past month
179:23
and a half
179:24
no
179:25
um
179:26
yeah till this day i still don't know
179:30
what
179:30
sorcerer i hardly even know where it
179:33
means
179:38
i didn't even know until like a week ago
179:40
i had to google it
179:42
oh okay so the joke is
179:45
it sounds like
179:47
when a word ends in an er it sounds like
179:49
her
179:53
so then it's sometimes when it's a word
179:56
like like what's the example
179:58
uh
180:00
like when you say
180:02
i don't
180:03
what's what's not inappropriate
180:05
that i could use
180:09
why why was that the first place your
180:11
mind went oh oh like like liquor
180:15
sounds like lick her
180:18
and you're like
180:20
liquor i hardly even know her
180:24
[Music]
180:32
so for sorcerer
180:34
right let's say for example it's like
180:36
what they're saying is if someone says
180:37
to you the word sorcerer
180:40
right what though because the er sounds
180:42
like her it means that the first part of
180:44
the word is a verb so they're telling
180:46
you to saucer
180:49
her oh
180:56
[Music]
181:01
you're a crafty one you know that
181:04
you hardly even know her
181:08
hey
181:09
yeah
181:10
yeah they're finally getting now
181:12
dude what the i'm glad
181:14
it's like when we were thinking about
181:17
those like
181:18
lines i think um i can still remember
181:22
when
181:23
you told us that
181:25

181:49
cool yeah that's good
181:51
i don't have to listen to it
181:54
yeah i was uh
181:56
yeah another part about my line i
181:58
i thought up so many different like puns
182:02
and the one line that wasn't a pun was
182:04
the one that ended up being chosen
182:08
oh yeah that's right
182:10
i mean yeah i'm glad that they picked it
182:12
like it's grown on me immensely what was
182:15
it again it was like

185:16
well i mean is the only thing
185:18
it doesn't have experience here
185:23
it'll take longer i watched the entire
185:25

188:11
all right i went i went to um i have to
188:14
install uh
188:17
the new enough game on my on my ps5 for
188:19
tomorrow so i picked up my controller
188:20
and knocked over an empty can and it
188:22
kind of cash wait it's on ps5
188:25
yeah
188:26
i thought it was going to be i thought
188:27
it was pc yeah
188:29
it's both it's both yeah the pc the pc
188:31
one is a port and apparently the port is
188:33
like very not well optimized so i'm
188:35
gonna to avoid shenanigans i'm gonna get
188:37
on ps5
188:39
i see i see
188:42
and did i watched you play that vr f
188:45
game yesterday
188:46
oh that was awful
188:49
the amount of technical gubbins i mean
188:51
it was funny but it's the fact that my
188:53
space is so small that like i kept i
188:55
kept just like trying to play the game
188:58
but there was not physically enough
188:59
space and i kept like smacking my mic
189:01
with the controllers
189:03
and oh god but it was fun it was funny
189:06
shoe and ike should do a gorilla voice
189:12
uh
189:14
i never try
189:17
or have i no try it no
189:21
you can like turn on a four-man shifter
189:24
uh hello
189:27
that's not that's not half bad
189:48
give me a moment i'm not talking i was
189:50
just gonna point out the fact that this
189:52
starly that
189:53
had your name was a girl i think
189:58
i think so yeah i know i know i can do
190:00
it it's just fitting
190:01
pretty good no no no no no no no like i
190:03
am
190:04
i'm i'm but an amateur
190:08
i'm actually really really excited for
190:10
my doki doki stream tomorrow
190:13
i kind of want to finish the entire
190:14
thing in one run
190:16
one stream oh
190:18
i imagine you could i imagine you could
190:20
probably do that i mean it's it's it's
190:22
kind of long but not that long
190:25
how long are we talking about if it was
190:27
if you were to read the uh the words one
190:29
by one without skipping anything
190:32
is it like oh that might take a while
190:35
um
190:36
if you read and i googled it and
190:38
apparently it takes five or six hours to
190:39
finish but then i imagine if you do um
190:42
like if you do the side stories and
190:44
stuff i'd imagine if you did if you did
190:47
an endurance maybe like nine or ten
190:49
hours i imagine you could definitely
190:50
finish it
190:53
i think i got this
190:54
i think i got it ah
190:57
and
190:58
like even though i i did an endurance
191:00
stream today and it was like it was it
191:02
was very very long and it was quite
191:04
quite arduous
191:06
um i would say it's quite rewarding like
191:07
you come away from it feeling like yeah
191:09
i did yeah i've heard such good uh
191:11
reviews on it
191:14
i guess i've played it right
191:16
is it is it yeah no i've i i love doki
191:18
doki i think it's incredible
191:20
i i haven't played the ddlc plus but i
191:23
have played the original
191:26
i have no idea what the difference uh
191:28
well give me a second me either
191:31
i have absolutely no idea what the
191:32
difference is even though i own two
191:34
physical copies of it i believe isn't
191:37
dlc plus basically just that like the
191:39
box comes with some goodies and they
191:41
also add side stories with new cgs and
191:43
stuff
191:44
uh also
191:45
i wouldn't know
191:47
i i haven't looked up any spoilers about
191:48
it because i do eventually want to get
191:50
around to it i have a friend who's like
191:51
obsessed with doki doki and so i i got
191:54
and like when it was announced i got a
191:55
real earful about it
191:57
i had a phase where i was really
192:00
really obsessed with that like i'm
192:01
already visual novel trash and what that
192:03
came along and it reminded me of like
192:05
another really famous visual law that i
192:07
hadn't read at the time because it
192:08
wasn't translated
192:09
[Music]
192:12
guys who is best girl
192:16

192:19

noises is that he was sucked headfirst

into a pokeball knowing not what lay on

putting the oof in the doof
200:14
well uh what's your fate
200:16
what should be the pokemons that i i
200:18
would go for you know
200:21
in a game like this uh a live ones
200:25
a live one
200:34
i do have a live ones
200:36
it just oh yeah live one
200:38
[Laughter]
200:41
did you just say i have a live ones
200:43
they're just dead yeah
200:45
then they're not alive
200:50
because you just said they're dead
200:54
kind of true
200:59
[Music]
201:00
[Laughter]
201:03
you can't just refute that they're
201:06
they're alive by saying that they're
201:07
dead though
201:10
well i have one alive dude one one
201:13
they're alive
201:15
in the case of death
201:16
[Laughter]
201:19
we believe
201:20
we believe
201:22
we believe in this listen fox is gonna
201:24
be like over level level 100 swiping
201:27
every everyone everyone
201:31
i mean isn't that how everybody plays
201:33
their first pokemon game they just over
201:35
level the crap out of their starter and
201:38
then they have no type coverage
201:40
oh yeah that's me with torterra at the
201:42
snow point gym
201:46
actually
201:49
i don't even know how i learned how to
201:50
catch pokemon
201:54
wait what
201:55
cause i i mean
201:57
you play pokemon games as a kid right
202:00
but uh-huh
202:03
you know what i mean like
202:05
it's not like you know how to catch a
202:07
pokemon
202:08
even though they have a tutorial
202:11
they teach you though
202:12
like do you really have the computer
202:14
different is this the firmware i think
202:16
so yeah
202:17
oh then you could catch a pokemon but i
202:19
can't have the same one i think
202:22
yeah but if you run into the same thing
202:23
that's dupes then you can just skip that
202:26
one until you run into something that
202:27
you haven't caught before gotcha gotcha
202:35
good thing that you don't need to like
202:37
make the
202:38
make your box learn
202:40
roxy in this game
202:42
oh do they make it oh yeah they they
202:45
they fixed that oh that was one thing
202:47
that kind of bothered me again about gen
202:49
4 the
202:50
8 hms that you needed
202:53
the people tell me cynthia is very hard
202:57
yeah she if you're unprepared she will
203:00
mop the floor with you
203:03

203:05
bit of good work now but it was great

207:37
actually to be honest with you i don't
207:39
know how people continue to play
207:41
when the starter dies
207:43
i'd be really sad i wouldn't play
207:44
anymore
207:46
oh
207:47
yeah i feel that
207:53
this room knows luck in a title and
207:54
we'll look away ah
207:56
come on guys easy mode
207:59
oh we're not going easy mode
208:02
we need hardware yeah yeah yeah
208:06
need a little
208:09
say what's your opinion on bug pokemon
208:15
what's that
208:16
fox afternoon
208:18
and that that's a bug cut what's his
208:20
name again oh brandon
208:28
and the one thing i really hate in
208:29
pokemon games uh
208:31
like
208:33
the bug type trainers
208:36
oh really you feel the same way
208:38
it's like
208:39
i don't know
208:42
they poison you they paralyze you they
208:46
uh
208:47
they do so much
208:49
so many things
208:53
i guess so yeah
208:59
but you have the type advantage
209:02
easy
209:05
yeah it's like uh
209:07
it's like meeting a fisherman
209:09
in a game like this and they have like
209:11
five magikops that's what it feels
209:14
that's what it's like
209:17
yeah i i don't
209:20
i don't i don't understand those
209:22
fishermen
209:24
really have
209:25
five
209:25
five [ __ ] level two magikops
209:29
oh yeah and they challenge you to a
209:31
battle
209:32
like oh
209:34
i guess i have carp in my
209:36
in my cooler box i'll whip them out all
209:38
right fight it
209:39
and all it's gonna do is flop
209:42
yeah it's so annoying
209:45
oh twins live and liz
209:50
yellow's gonna die
209:55
or
209:56
oh double battle
210:01

210:13
i think this is
210:14
uh yellow please
210:17
50 50 50 50.
210:22
yes people thought nice nice
210:32
that's okay
210:35
use match punch
210:38
and here's confusion again
210:46
i saw you playing that big brain thing
210:47
today how the hell are you doing that's
210:49
so fast
210:51
what's actually kind of crazy
210:53
uh you counting blocks
210:57
oh you're like oh um
211:00
four times eight
211:02
oh yeah you have like all this three
211:04
times four 99
211:09
oh yeah
211:10
i mean it's just the
211:12
what do you call it multiplication in
211:14
the end
211:18
wait do you like
211:20
are you actually
211:23
like very
211:27
you're actually very very good at math
211:30
i want to give you a sorcery expertise
211:33
i'd say
211:35
i'm more of a math person
211:38
my history is so bad
211:41
your history
211:43
yeah
211:45
in comparison to like my math grades my
211:48
history grades are like
211:50
oh yeah
211:52
and then like i didn't retain anything
211:54
from my history classes
211:55
like
211:57
one year i like cram for the
211:59
final and then i'm like okay
212:03
and then i write everything down and
212:04
then i'm like okay
212:06
and i forgot everything and i had like
212:07
history class in high school
212:10
i don't know
212:12
i know i never did it at a very high
212:14
level so
212:17
um it was uh
212:19
it was a little boring not gonna lie
212:23
it was a little boring
212:26
we're just learning about
212:33
it depends on the topic for
212:34
me like what's your favorite unit about
212:37
like
212:38
primal apes
212:41
well you get to learn that
212:43
what
212:45
really yeah just like one unit
212:52
the neanderthals and the
212:55
ah
212:57
i thought you were talking about actual
212:59
apes
213:00
oh no no no no like pre-human
213:04
pre-human history
213:06
i think that one was pretty interesting
213:11
we only did the uh
213:13
pyramid
213:15
after that i never know yeah i never did
213:18
i never did it again we made it to the
213:20
town yes
213:23
let's go
213:25
and uh yellow's still alive
213:30
exactly
213:32
depends on a teacher
213:36
um
213:37
that's also true
213:41
i did physics more in high school
213:43
actually but
213:44
i barely remember that oh physics
213:48
i don't even know them anymore
213:54
yeah physics class
213:58
i get the impression vox is good with
214:02
history yeah he's like
214:03
nine hundred years old
214:08
oh yeah
214:09
he's doing he come from goku

225:01
yep right now
225:03
let's go
225:08

226:02
[Laughter]
226:04
let's
226:05
[Music]
226:07
would you go
226:08
you consider a hashtag just for lucy
226:14
what's that gonna be though
226:16
what's gonna be in the
226:19
lucy fan
226:21
is lucy fanon oh my god
226:27
my older sister had a pomeranian would
226:29
always act like it hated me
226:33
when i showed up it would love oh yeah
226:36
i've never really had a pet so
226:39
i can't really relate if that makes
226:41
sense
226:45
makes sense
226:46
it's also hard to like
226:47
imagine
226:49
owning an animal that
226:52
you haven't owned
226:55
i want a dog or a character
227:01
i feel like you'd enjoy a dog a lot
227:04
i think so too but um yeah
227:06
you got gonna have some responsibilities
227:08
as well i think
227:11
oh you gotta walk them feed them
227:14
play with them
227:18
make sure they don't
227:19
bite people
227:21
when you say fan art i remember mrs
227:23
fanart yeah missa is actually the first
227:26
one to ever make me fan of
227:28
chew second i think yeah
227:30
i was about to make that fan art
227:33
uh my twitter header
227:36
twitter banner oh yeah yeah
227:40
wait did that ever get shown to the
227:41
public the one i drew i don't think so
227:45
okay
227:46
[Music]
227:47
then like really really tough tougher
227:49
than i could put into words and i know a
227:52
lot of words
227:53
we're done for now
227:55
let's get back to the valley windworks
228:00

for everyone to see
228:28
of honey
228:34
are you scared of bees
228:37
uh
228:40
not
228:41
as much as i used to be
228:45
like recently i've realized
228:48
as long as it's not like a whole swarm
228:50
of them i think i'm okay with it
228:54
yeah i'm pretty scared
228:58
i'm very very scared of it
229:05
like uh actually you know what what even
229:07
what scares me even more is when you
229:09
like ride a bike here
229:11
you always have to like wear a helmet
229:14
that has like little uh
229:16
like zip lock
229:18
oh no no what's it called ziploc no not
229:20
ziploc uh
229:23
you kind of you kind of have to
229:26
put like little spikes
229:28
on top of your helmet
229:30
it's not actual spikes it's just plastic
229:33
uh-huh
229:35
because the birds will would always come
229:37
in and swoop you
229:40
whoa literally
229:42
oh yeah it would it no it'll attack you
229:47
yeah the magpies the magpies right
229:52
oh okay
229:54
dang but that's only for bikes
229:57
oh yeah well if if you're wearing
229:59
something like reflective like uh
230:02
like a helmet
230:03
like oh it's another bird i'm going to
230:05
attack it
230:06
like that
230:08
i see i see yeah and it's swooping
230:10
season two
230:13
oh there's a whole season for that yeah
230:15
i'd assume
230:17
it's not actual spikes it's it's uh
230:21
yeah it's zip ties
230:23
that's what it is
230:25
oh you just put those on your helmet
230:26
yeah
230:28
oh okay
230:30
yeah they kind of see it like they kind
230:32
of see it as a as a spike even though it
230:34
doesn't hurt hurt them
230:36
i think no
230:40
you didn't have souping in the u.s
230:43
