61:32
you know
61:34
he makes an effort speaking english i
61:36
need to make an effort to speak japanese
61:38
also
61:39
does that make sense
61:50
right
61:54
i know i'm late congrats on the super
61:55

61:57
[Music]
61:59
oh wait whoops
62:07
thank you yuki thank you
62:10
thanks so much
62:13
how was the interview infinity sanji did
62:15
you find it scary yeah of course i did
62:20
yeah but like
62:21
the thing is like the way i wanted to
62:24
approach the audition was just to be as
62:26
confident as i can be right
62:31
and chad i know i'm pretty i get pretty
62:33
nervous when i'm put on the spot i
62:34
really do
62:35
but
62:37
you know
62:39
if you ever make it to like the uh the
62:41
interview process i think
62:44
they know
62:46
they know you're gonna act they know
62:47
you're going to be nervous
62:49
so
62:50
i think being being able to show them
62:52
that you're not
62:55
it's kind of like a plus

66:46
[Music]
66:52
endure no don't let it
66:57
and then it happened pog
67:00
wait what story
67:03
yeah before they opened auditions i
67:05
actually
67:07
i emailed ninja sanji to
67:10
the urbana branch
67:11
an english
67:12
branch and
67:15
um
67:17
like just just open auditions right
67:20
they never got back to me
67:22
but
67:24
here we are pug
67:30
it's pretty cringe you shouldn't even do
67:32
that right
67:34
they're not gonna get back to you
67:43
what did they even ask
67:46
uh
67:47
i can't remember it's it's
67:49
i don't know why literally as soon as i
67:52
finish the interviews i cannot remember
67:55
the questions they asked me
68:00
like literally
68:11
i couldn't even remember it
68:17
probably
68:20
did you find a viewing or auditioning
68:21
with uh with
68:22
harder um
68:24
the auditions was a lot more stressful
68:26
and hard
68:28
because
68:30
there was no worry oh well there was a
68:32
lot of worries
68:33
obviously like
68:35
your audition to kind of want to get in
68:38
even if you do it as a joke
68:41
there's like a slight feeling in you
68:45
that you want to get in
68:47
right
68:49
and
68:54
uh
68:58
yeah like there was a lot of worries
69:00
i obviously really wanted to get in and
69:02
i found that more stressful and kind of
69:06
it's very very nerve-wracking
69:09
because i didn't know if i was i was
69:10
gonna get in or not
69:15
as for the debut
69:17
like
69:19
i [ __ ] up
69:24
as for the debut
69:28
okay
69:31
as for the debut
69:33
i was nervous but i was more nervous for
69:36
the twitter debut
69:38
i'll be honest with you
69:40
i was more scared for that than the
69:41
actual debut
69:44
when we were finally announced
69:46
i was like
69:49
i was very very very
69:53
very
69:55
like stressed
70:00
i don't know why
70:03
like everyone like all of us i think
70:05
like we were very
70:09
like nervous
70:12
little did you know
70:13
the only one that had anything to fear
70:15
from twitter was me yeah i was jailed
70:23
thank you like pog you thank you pog you
70:28
how was the first time meeting your gen
70:30
mates
70:31
again i i
70:33
i was pretty nervous
70:37
i think all of us were
70:45
is that this that's like worries right
70:48
are we gonna
70:49
are we gonna
70:51
are we gonna sink well
70:53
you know
70:54
are we gonna
70:56
vibe together
70:58
like there was always that worry
71:00
and i'm glad we did
71:03
i'm glad
71:05
i'm glad we did
71:18
i'm glad we did
71:19
did you imagine what you disliked
71:22
did you imagine what if you dislike
71:24
someone no i i never really imagined
71:26
what if i dislike someone it was more
71:28
like
71:32
you know
71:33
what if they didn't like me
71:37
you know
71:42
it was kind of like that
71:50
because i think my personality is a
71:52
little uh too upfront sometimes and
71:56
very loud
71:58
even off stream i'm like that
72:00
and
72:03
yeah i wasn't i wasn't sure how people
72:05
are gonna react
72:20
i say some pretty random stuff it's
72:23
actually
72:25
like it's weird
72:37
pretty pog stuff
72:42
can't be worse than mr
72:44

73:18
stream but
73:23
like he isn't like wow like whoa
73:27

about this and that and and
157:50
how the guy is
157:53
is trying to overcome his feelings
157:55
but then the teacher says oh
158:00

158:03
you know
158:05
that's exactly what english is
158:07

158:53
in my country is probably different
158:54
compared to english
158:57
i think it's it's it's it's somewhat
158:59
similar
159:01
when i had my english classes
159:04
i don't know my
159:05
my teachers would always hate it
159:07
whenever i

159:45
every single time i would

my
159:53
dude my teachers would always get mad at
159:56
me
159:59
they always
160:01
english teachers disliked me
160:05
now other teachers they were fine you
160:07

160:22
books you know i don't like that
160:28

161:15
here
161:16
[Music]
161:22
and i hated books
161:24
when i was like like even younger
161:26
i dislike books as well because you know
161:30
p p e class was one of my favorite
161:32
subjects
161:33
but my teacher would always leave me out
161:36
of it
161:38
always leave me out of it
161:41
why because i i haven't finished my
161:44
harry potter book
161:53
yo you can't get into the pool because
161:55
you haven't finished your book yet and
161:57
i'm just there sitting down watching
161:59
people
162:02
harry potter book that's why i hate
162:04
harry potter books i hate books in
162:06
general because of that
162:08
[Music]
162:09
which characters do you love buzz and
162:11
othello i can't even remember the story
162:17
what i would do
162:18
what i would do during high school
162:21
is that would be like uh
162:24
so when we need to read books
162:26
i would just go up to like someone
162:28
and be like oh so what do you think
162:30
about like the
162:31
chapter one you know
162:33
what do you think about chapter one
162:37
and they would tell me about it and they
162:39
kind of summarize
162:41
yeah they just summarize
162:43
what it is
162:45
and
162:46
i would just listen to it
162:47
next person
162:49
chapter two
162:50
right
162:56
and then
162:57
yeah
162:58
that's basically it
163:01
but then you have like things you have
163:02
questions such as
163:04
uh
163:05
what's the difference between the book
163:07
and the movie
163:22
hi luca you're so awesome and cute i

165:22
[Music]
165:24
i'm sorry
165:26
i cheated with youtube videos for
165:27
reading books i ironically had the best
165:30
pe grades even if i barely participate
165:34
[Music]
165:35
the thing i dislike about pe is how
165:37
you're graded on how well you do
165:42
you know what i mean
165:43
like even if you're like the most unfit
165:45
person
165:47
like if you
165:49
one time we needed to like run five
165:51
kilometers
165:55
and if you like
165:57
in like 20 minutes for example
165:59
if you did like 30 minutes you grade it
166:02
down i don't i don't
166:04
that's so unfair
166:10
i'm not speaking for myself i'm speaking
166:11
for the people that couldn't make it in
166:13
20 minutes
166:27
it is but i imagine that you would excel
166:28
well
166:31
like for the other people yeah it's very
166:33
unfair right
166:35
you're like an unfit person
166:37
and you're graded on how fast or like
166:39
how well you do a physical test i don't
166:41
think that's really fair you know
166:43
i guess if you choose to if you choose
166:45
the um the subject i guess it's kind of
166:48
on you
166:57

we're jumping you have more control if

that makes sense
252:24
like you really just have to know

252:31
like what you need to like how long you
252:33
have to hold it down
252:35
we're getting over it
252:38
it's a little hard i guess
252:40
because uh
252:41
it's a little
252:42
inconsistent
252:45
you have to fight the uh the physics
252:46
engine as well of the game
252:49
but
252:51
it can be easy it can be easy you just
252:54
gotta know
252:55
like where to put your hammer
253:25
bit please
253:29
it's designed to have bad controls yeah
253:35
it's all about control yeah
