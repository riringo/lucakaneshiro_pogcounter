for a person who's uses pogolite i'm
118:41
surprised you don't have bgtv or 7tv
118:45
um
118:46
that's because youtube doesn't really
118:48
have it
118:50

youtube doesn't really have
118:56
bt tv
118:58
and uh 7tv
119:00
which it does i know it does but
119:04
i think uh the way it works is
119:08
like
119:09
you gotta be
119:14
[ __ ] uh
119:16
you gotta be hand-picked by the person

119:23
pog emote uploaded

just thought after i was talking about
217:12
sigma stairs on um thingy on the the
217:14
lucky dragon host club the other day i
217:16
saw a thumbnail which is just me from
217:17
the from from the hope in the dark music
217:19
videos saying how i'd be looking at
217:20
women after i drink their pepper spray
217:24
[Music]
217:27
it's a terrifying concept to me because
217:29
i'd like to imagine that you have so you
217:31
have you you have like after effects
217:33
level motion tracking to the point where
217:35
it's sprayed at you and you just your
217:36
head moves to catch every droplet and
217:38
then you just stare at them completely
217:39
blankly
217:41
i'm sorry i'm not over the fact that you
217:42
sit after a face level motion tracking
217:45
that is not a good bar descent
217:48
i'm sorry
217:51
oh no i'm not familiar with after
217:53
effects it all looks like wizardry for
217:54
me

226:34
i've ever experienced is that i even
226:36
though people make out ouija boards to
226:38
be this like mystical magical thing when
226:40
i watched a movie called ouija one of
226:42
the first icons i saw was hasbro because
226:44
hasbro means the rights to ouija
226:48
ding-dong

230:09

230:12

230:21
i am so invested oh
230:23
[Music]
230:24
oh my god no
230:26
no oh
230:28
no no no no no no
230:30
no oh no
230:34
it's fine you don't you don't have to
230:36
stop yourself on the time you can keep
230:39
playing it's okay
230:41
it's fine
230:42
it's fine i think
230:44
i think if you made it like three jumps
230:46
away in the time run out i i i i think i
230:49
would i would i would i would bust bust
230:52
down your door and then finish the game
230:53
myself even if i fell down to the
230:55
beginning
231:00
at least
231:03
the worst part is like you didn't react
231:05
when you fell so i only cause sometimes
231:07
you react and then we see it on stream
231:09
right but you didn't react so we just
231:11
watched you fall deeper and deeper and
231:13
deeper
231:14
this is so painful you know
231:17
that was such a big fall
231:22
[Music]
231:24
but it's fine hey
231:26
it only takes one minute to get back
231:28
there
231:31
hold on [ __ ] me never mind uh two
231:33
minutes
231:35
three and a half the the stark contrast
231:38
into the f-bomb kinda caught me off
231:40
guard
231:45
luca strikes me as one of those people
231:47
that
231:48
does cuss a lot but doesn't seem like it
231:50
he is so
231:52
when you
231:53
it catches you off guard even though you
231:55
know that they're prone to cussing
231:59
only when i'm angry okay
232:01
only when i mean i've never heard luca
232:03
cuss until this stream to be honest
232:06
only when i'm angry
232:08
because this stream let's it stuff
232:16
i love jump king guys
232:18
i love this game
232:27
i'm crying
232:28
[Laughter]
232:31
i'm not even playing it i'm so sad
232:35
[Music]
232:36
[Laughter]
232:40
oh someone loves it too nice good
232:43
i'm not the only dog
232:45
actually like super pog
232:49
super pog
232:51
different from a regular pog
232:54
super mega ultra hyper pug have you ever
232:56
seen that one
232:58
no
232:59
oh come
233:06
you know i'm not actually as tilted as
233:11
i thought i was gonna be
233:13
does that make sense you just just sort
233:15
of hit a state of zen
233:17
yeah like i just
233:19
i don't care anymore
233:21
i just want to finish this right
233:23
that's why we hear him like break his
233:25
cider in the background
233:28
punch his computer
233:31
i think you need monkey paper
233:34
has any of you ever
233:36
hit the level of rage where you have
233:38
enacted violence upon inanimate objects
233:43
i think because everyone has that one
233:44
point
233:45
oh yeah
233:47
yep
233:48
i mean fox i can't like that that sounds
233:50
terrible but i
233:52
say like yeah of course you have but
233:54
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i mean i i
233:58
didn't smash my [ __ ] keyboard
234:01
i'm sorry the swearing really caught me
234:03
off guard
234:04
see see what i mean
234:07
i haven't um like i don't think on
234:09
stream i've ever like properly i think i
234:12
think i put my controller down with
234:13
force
234:14
when cat gaming spiked me once
234:19
other than that like i think we've all i
234:21
think the whole thing about
234:23
i love that in the fight and game
234:24
community it's called spiking your
234:25
controller
234:27
that's funny
234:29
right and it's like i remember i
234:30
remember watching a hungry box video it
234:32
was like reacting to the the saltiest
234:34
controller spikes and he's like oh look
234:36
at the angle on that that was vicious oh
234:38
i want to give i want to give him some
234:39
money for that i feel like i feel like i
234:40
need to buy a ticket to watch that
234:41
happen but
234:44
i feel bad because it's like it's a very
234:46
small light object that's right in your
234:49
hands that you own and then when you're
234:51
extremely annoyed it's like yeah why
234:53
wouldn't i just
234:55
who
234:56
you know like
234:58
[ __ ] you
235:02
it's okay luca it's okay it's okay luke
235:06
what's okay
235:09
[Music]
235:20
[Music]
235:26
i think i haven't thrown a controller
235:29
but i remember when i was very young i
235:31
was trying to beat super mario brothers
235:34
deluxe
235:35
on a game boy color and it just kept
235:38
but they had
235:40
i just kept dying and then i just
235:42
started like banging the table
235:45
i didn't break anything
235:48
they have
235:49
they have mario games on the game boy
235:52
on the gameboy color they had super
235:54
mario brothers deluxe which was a port
235:56
of
235:56
the original with a bunch of extra
235:58
features and i think they also included
236:01
the lost levels i thought they only had
236:03
pokemon
236:05
no wait
236:07
you think the only game they have on the
236:09
boy color is pokemon yeah
236:11
not even tetris because that's what i
236:13
had
236:17
but no other franchise than pokemon yeah
236:21
probably dora the explorer but like
236:27
yeah i had that game too
236:30
oh so the games you had were the ones
236:32
that existed
236:33
no other game exists except
236:37
i just saw pokemon games too
236:39
goodbye does it exist
236:44
oh my god
236:46
he's adorable [ __ ]
236:48
nice
236:52
i wonder if i should take my leftover
236:54
pizza and put it and put it in the oven
236:56
do it
236:58
don't burn it like i missed it
237:01
wait mister burned his pizza
237:03
yeah before we debuted i was talking to
237:05
him
237:06
and he like
237:07
almost burnt
237:09
he had to evacuate his house
237:11
he's already
237:12
but unfortunately this is the wrong
237:14
thing
237:15
he forgot it was there
237:17
and it started burning
237:21
to be fair i've done something similar i
237:23
set my popcorn on fire once
237:25
you popcorn how
237:27
how does that happen it was it was
237:29
microwave popcorn i put it into the
237:31
microwave
237:33
and i set it for like three minutes once
237:35
those three minutes were up i was just
237:36
like you know what not all these are
237:38
popping i'm gonna give it like another
237:39
minute and thirty seconds we'll pretend
237:41
you didn't see the thing in the
237:42
thumbnail yeah that was too much
237:45
so then when i opened the microwave it
237:47
was like smoking i opened the bag it was
237:50
smoking a lot more and i was like oh no
237:51
let me blow on it little did i know when
237:53
i blew on it i can't essentially kind of
237:55
treated it like a campfire so i made it
237:58
worse so it just started smoking even
238:01
a lot more
238:05
dude i don't even know how you like
238:08
it's apparently his um his
238:12
his uh oven caught on fl how does it
238:14
even happen
238:17
that means you forgot it in there for
238:18
like
238:19
a while way over
238:20
like the pizza just burned in the oven
238:23
i just miscalculated i didn't forget
