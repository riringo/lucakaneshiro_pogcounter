[Music]
11:25
hey
11:30
okay hello hold on
11:32
how's the music how's it sound
11:36
i see an annoying girl running toward me
11:39
from the distance waving her arms in the
11:41
air like she's totally oblivious to any
11:43
attention she might draw to herself
11:48
that girl sayori
11:50
my neighbor and good friends
11:53
since we were children
11:55
you know the kind of friend you see
11:57
never see yourself making today but it
11:59
just kind of works out because you've
12:01
known each other for so long
12:04
we used to walk to school together on
12:05
days like this but starting around high
12:07
school
12:08
she would oversleep more and more
12:10
frequently and i would get tired of
12:12
waiting up
12:18
wait what no
12:20
however i decide an idol in front of the
12:22
crosswalk and let's say yori catch up to
12:24
me
12:28
ah
12:30
i overslept again
12:33
but i caught you this time
12:36
maybe it's oh god guys
12:40
maybe but only because i decided to stop
12:42
and wait for you
12:44
uh
12:45
uh
12:47
you say that you like
12:48
ah
12:50
guys
12:51
let me get in the game okay
12:55
this is going to be a long-ass stream
12:57
jesus
13:01
uh
13:02
you say it
13:05
you say that like you were
13:07
thinking about ignoring me
13:10
that's mean luca
13:12
well if people stare at you for acting
13:14
weird then i don't want them to think
13:15
with or a couple or something
13:18
fine fine
13:20
but you did wait for me after all
13:22
i guess you don't have i guess you don't
13:24
have it in you to be mean even if you
13:25
want to
13:27
whatever you say sayori
13:32
we crossed the street together and make
13:34
our way to school
13:36
as we draw near the streets become
13:38
increasingly speckled with other
13:40
students making their daily commute
13:44
uh by the way luca
13:46
have you decided on a club to join yet
13:51
so you already more like sheila
13:54
a club
13:56
i told you already
13:57
i'm not really interested in joining any
13:59
clubs
14:00
i haven't been walking either
14:03
ah
14:04
that's not true
14:05
you told me you were gonna join a club
14:07
this year
14:09
did i
14:11
i'm sure it's possible that i did in one
14:13
of my many conversations where i
14:15
dismissively go along with whatever
14:16
she's going on about
14:18
that's good that's good
14:22
sayori likes to worry about a little too
14:24
much about me when i'm perfectly content
14:26
just getting by on the average while
14:28
spending my free time on games and
14:31
anime
14:34
uh-uh
14:37
i was talking about how i'm worried that
14:39
you won't learn
14:40
you want to ah
14:42
you won't learn how to socialize or have
14:44
any skills before college
14:48
their happiness is really important to
14:50
me you know
14:51
and i know you're happy now but i die at
14:53
the thought of you becoming a need in a
14:55
few years because you're not used to the
14:57
real world
14:59
you trust me right
15:01
don't make me keep worrying about you
15:04
all right all right
15:05
i'll look at a few clubs if it makes you
15:07
happy
15:08
no promises there
15:11
will you at least keep will you at least
15:13
promise me you'll try a little
15:17
yeah i guess i'll promise you that
15:22
i'm cringing
15:26
why do i let myself oops why do i let
15:28
myself lectured get elected by such a
15:30
carefree girl
15:32
more than that i'm surprised i even let
15:34
myself relent to her
15:36
i guess seeing her worry so much about
15:38
me makes me want to ease her mind at
15:40
least a little bit
15:42
even if she does exaggerate everything
15:43
inside of my head
15:46
see guys i told you i can read i'm not
15:48
illiterate
15:50
the school day is as ordinary as ever
15:54
i hate the fact that i clicked this
15:55
purely because of the thumbnail
16:00
after i pack up my things i blankly
16:02
stare at the wall
16:04
i stare blankly at the wall looking for
16:05
an ounce of motivation
16:08
clubs
16:10
sayori wants me to check out some clubs
16:14
i guess i have no choice but to start
16:15
with the anime club anime fog
16:21
uh hello
16:23
hi mika
16:25
sayori
16:28
sayori must have come into the classroom
16:30
while off spacing out
16:32
i look around and realize that i'm not
16:34
the only one left in the classroom
16:37
i thought i'd catch you coming out of
16:38
the classroom but
16:40
i saw you just sitting here and spacing
16:42
out so i came in
16:45
honestly
16:46
you're even worse than me sometimes i'm
16:48
impressed
16:50
you don't need to wake up you don't need
16:52
to wait up for me if it's going to make
16:54
you late to your own club
16:58
well
16:59
i thought you might need some
17:00
encouragement so i thought
17:02
no no what
17:05
well that you could come to my club
17:08
sayori
17:13
there's no way i'm going to your club
17:17
meanie
17:21
what am i doing
17:25
what am i doing
17:30
sayori is the president of the
17:31
literature club
17:34
not that i was ever aware that she had
17:36
any interest in literature
17:39
literature literature
17:41
in fact i'm 99 sure she only did it
17:44
because she thought it would be fun to
17:45
help start a new club
17:47
since she was the first one to show
17:48
interest after the one who proposed the
17:50
club she inherited the title vice
17:53
president
17:54
are you guys enjoying so far
17:56
huh
17:58
look at kaneshiro's slave
18:01

18:04

18:09
what
18:11

18:13

18:18
20 hours left
18:20
i i promise you it's not a speed run
18:22
this time
18:26
okay that said my interest in literature
18:29
is guaranteed to be even less
18:32
yeah i'm going to the anime club
18:35
come on please
18:37
what do you care so much anyway
18:39
well
18:40
i kind of told the club yesterday that i
18:42
would
18:43
bring in new members
18:45
and natsuki made cups
18:48
cupcakes and everything
18:52
don't make promises you can't keep
18:56
i can't tell so you i can't tell if
18:58
sayori is really that much of an airhead
19:00
or if she's so cunning as to have
19:02
planned all of this out
19:04
i'll let her let out
19:08
alongside fine
19:11
i'll stop by for a cupcake okay
19:14
yes let's go
19:18
and thus
19:19
today marks the day i sold myself for a
19:22
cupcake
19:24
i dejectedly follow sayori across the
19:27
school
19:28
upstairs
19:29
a section of the school i rarely visit
19:33
sayori full of energy swings open the
19:36
classroom door
19:40
everyone
19:42
the new member is here
19:46
i told you don't call me a new member
19:49
huh
19:50
i glanced around the room
19:53
oh god
19:55
go one
19:58
well
19:59
welcome to the literature club
20:01
welcome welcome welcome
20:03
welcome to the literature club it's a
20:06
pleasure meeting you
20:08
sayori is always saying nice things
20:10
about you
20:12
seriously
20:13
you brought a boy
20:17
way to kill the atmosphere
20:23
wait
20:30
what a nice surprise
20:34
to the club
20:38
oh god
20:40
guys it's gonna take me some time to get
20:41
used to it okay
20:43
please don't make fun of me
20:45
don't make fun of me
20:48
this club
20:50
is full of
20:52
incredibly cute
20:55
girls girls girls
21:02
what are you looking at
21:05
if you want to say something say it
21:09
sorry
21:11
natsuki
21:16
the girl with the sound attitude whose
21:18
name is apparently natsuki is one i
21:19
don't recognize
21:21
a small figure
21:23
a small figure makes her look a lot like
21:26
a first year student
21:28
she is also the one who made cupcakes
21:30
according to sayori
21:33
you can just ignore her when she gets
21:35
moody
21:37
sayori says
21:38
ah there's so many tags require why am i
21:41
doing this in the first place okay guys
21:45
we have to we have to finish this today
21:50
right
21:52
sayori says that quietly into my ear
21:54
then turns back towards the other girls
21:58
anyway this is natsuki
22:01
always full of energy
22:03
and this is yuri
22:04
the smartest in the club
22:07
the don't say things like that
22:10
yuri who appears comparably more mature
22:12
and timid
22:13
seems to have a hard time keeping up
22:15
with people like sayori natsuki
22:18
ah well
22:20
it's nice to meet both of you
22:22
guys guys i'm gonna get a girlfriend i'm
22:25
gonna get a girlfriend pog fog
22:27
bug
22:30
it sounds like you already know monika
22:33
is that right
22:35
that's right
22:38
it's great to see you again luca
22:41
monica smiles sweetly
22:45
we do know each other very very well we
22:48
really talked
22:49
but we were in the same class last year
22:54
monaco is probably the most popular girl
22:56
in class smart beautiful athletic
22:59
basically completely out of my league
23:02
so having her smile at me so genuinely
23:05
feels so
23:06
feels a little
23:08
[Music]
23:10
you
23:11
you too monica
23:13
come sit down look
23:15
i forgot to oh no
23:18

23:20

23:23
monica besco
23:25
hey i made them i'll get them
23:29
sorry i got a little excited
23:32
then
23:33
how about i make some tea as well
23:38
the girls have a few desks arranged to
23:40
form a table
23:42
as the yuri mentioned
23:44
it's been widened
23:46
so that there's one space next to monica
23:48
and one space next to sayori
23:51
natsuki nuri walked over walk over to
23:53
the corner of the room of the room
23:55
bernarski grabs a wrapped tray and yuri
23:57
opens the closet ah
24:01
still feeling awkward i take a scene
24:03
next to sayori
24:04
natsuki proudly marches back to the
24:06
table tray in hand
24:13
okay
24:15
are you ready
24:19
um are you ready
24:25
ah goddamn yanovsky
24:32
ah
24:35
natsuki lifts the foil off the tray to
24:37
reveal a dozen white fluffy cupcakes
24:39
decorated to look like little cats
24:42
the whiskers are drawn with icing and
24:43
little pieces of chocolate were used to
24:45
make this pork
24:46
cupcakes
24:48
cupcakes
24:49
so cute
24:53
i had no idea you were so good at baking
24:56
natsuki
24:57
i got dude
25:01
i don't know monica kind of sounds like
25:02
a valley girl um
25:05
like oh my god
25:07
i had no idea you were so good at making
25:09
natsuki
25:11
like
25:12
wow
25:16
well
25:18
you know
25:20
just hurry and take one
25:22
sayori grabs one first and monica i
25:24
follow
25:28
it's delicious
25:30
sayori talks with a mouthful and has
25:32
already managed to get icing off of her
25:34
face
25:35
i turn the cupcake around on my fingers
25:37
looking for the best angle to take a
25:40
bite natsuki is quiet
25:44
quiet
25:46
[Music]
25:47
i can't help but notice her sneaking
25:50
glances at my direction
25:52
is she waiting for me to take a bite
25:55
i finally bite down
25:59
the icing is sweet
26:01
full of flavor
26:02
i wonder if she made it herself
26:06
this is really good
26:08
thank you natsuki
26:12

26:27
i thought you technically did so you
26:29
already said well maybe
26:32
not for you you know
26:37
all right all right
26:39
i give up i give up on natsuki's weird
26:41
logic and dismiss the conversation
26:44
you real yuri returns to the table
26:46
carrying a tea set
26:48
she carefully places a teacup in front
26:50
of in front of each of us before setting
26:52
down a teapot next to the cupcake tree
26:57
[Music]
27:00
um
27:01
you keep a whole tea set in the
27:02
classroom
27:04
don't worry
27:05
the teachers gave us permission
27:08
after all
27:09
doesn't a hot cup of coffee
27:13
doesn't a hot cup of coffee help you
27:14
enjoy a good book
27:16
uh i
27:17
i guess
27:21
like don't let you guys ah guys i can't
27:27
don't don't let yourself get intimidated
27:31
jewish is trying to impress you
27:35
that's not
27:38
insulted yuri looks away
27:41
i meant that
27:43
you know
27:44
i believe you
27:46
well tn reading might not be a pastime
27:48
for me but i at least
27:51
enjoy tea
27:53
i'm glad
27:55
yuri faintly smiles to herself in relief
27:58
and relief
28:01
monica raises an eyebrow and smiles at
28:03
me
28:06
guys
28:08
sorry chad sorry chad i'm
28:11
but i'm getting the ladies tonight
28:19
uh sorry so
28:21
what made you consider the literature
28:22
club
28:26
um
28:28
[ __ ] i was afraid of this question
28:31
something tells me i shouldn't tell
28:32
monica that i was practically there
28:34
dragged here by sayori
28:39
well i haven't joined any clubs yet and
28:41
sayori seemed really happy yes sir
28:46
that's okay
28:47
don't be embarrassed
28:49
well we'll make sure you feel right at
28:50
home okay
28:52
as president of the literature club
28:54
literature literature
28:57
literature literate
28:59
literature literature club
29:02
it's my duty to make the club fun and
29:03
exciting for everyone
29:06
monica
29:08
i'm surprised
29:10
how come you decided to start your own
29:11
club
29:13
you could probably be a board member for
29:14
any of the you know major clubs
29:20
weren't you a leader of the debate club
29:21
last year
29:25
well you know
29:28
to be honest
29:29
i can't stand all the politics politics
29:32
around the major clubs
29:34
it feels like nothing but arguing and
29:36
about the budget and publicity
29:40
and how to prepare for events
29:42
i'd much rather
29:48
hold on guys
29:50
[Music]
29:53
wow
29:54
how much longer do we have
29:58
i'd much rather take something i
30:00
personally enjoy and make something
30:02
special out of it
30:03
and
30:04
if it encourages others to get into
30:06
literature and also that i'm fulfilling
30:09
that dream
30:12
monica really is a great leader
30:16
yuri nods in agreement
30:20
then i'm surprised there aren't many
30:22
more people in the club yet
30:24
it must be hard to start a new club
30:27
you could put it that way
30:29
how many people are very interested in
30:30
putting all the effort to start off
30:32
something brand new
30:34
especially when it's something that
30:36
doesn't grab your attention like
30:38
literature
30:40
you have to work hard to convince people
30:42
that you're both fun and worthwhile
30:45
but it makes school events like the
30:47
festival that much more important
30:50
i'm confident that we we can all really
30:52
grow in this club before we graduate
30:56
right everyone
30:58
yeah
31:00
yeah
31:01
we'll do our best
31:03
you know it
31:06
everybody
31:07
enthusiastically agrees
31:12
such different girls all interested in
31:14
the same goal
31:17
monica must have worked really hard just
31:19
to find these three
31:21
maybe that's why they're all
31:22
they were all so delighted by the idea
31:24
of a new member joining
31:27
though
31:28
i still don't really know how
31:30
if i can keep up with that level of
31:31
enthusiasm about the literature
31:37
guys i like uh i like yuri so far
31:44
so uh luca what kinds of things do you
31:47
like to read
31:49
well uh
31:53
well uh
31:55
considering how little i've read the
31:57
past few years i don't really have a
31:59
good way of answering that
32:02
also like me what do you mean
32:08
both big
32:10
[Music]
32:14
okay dude
32:16
okay now a good one
32:18
wow wow
32:21
wow
32:25
wow
32:36
manga
32:38
[Music]
32:39
i muttered quietly to myself half
32:41
jerking
32:43
natsuki's head suddenly perks up
32:47
it looks like she wants to say something
32:48
but she keeps quiet
32:53
not much of a reader i guess
32:55
well well
32:56
that can change
32:58
what am i saying
33:00
i spoke without thinking after seeing
33:02
yuri's sad smile
33:05
anyway what about you yuri
33:08
well
33:09
let's see
33:12
he retraces the rim of her teacup with
33:14
her finger guys i can imagine it
33:22
my favorites
33:24
my favorites are usually novels that
33:26
build deep and complex fantasy worlds
33:32
a level of creativity and craftsmanship
33:35
behind them is amazing to me
33:38
and telling a good story in such a
33:40
foreign world is equally impressive
33:43
yuri goes on clearly passionate about
33:46
her reading
33:47
she seems so reverse and timid since the
33:49
moment i walked in but it's obvious by
33:51
the way her lies
33:53
her eyes light up she finds her comfort
33:55
in the world of books not people
33:58
but you know
34:00
i
34:00
[Music]
34:01
like a lot of things
34:03
stories with deep psychological elements
34:05
usually immersed me well
34:08
isn't it amazing how a writer can speak
34:10
can so deliberately take advantage of
34:12
your own lack of imagination to
34:14
completely throw you off the loop
34:17
anyway
34:18
i've been reading a lot of horror lately
34:21
ah
34:22
i read a
34:23
horror book once
34:25
i desp
34:26
i desperately grasped something i can
34:29
relate to at the minimal level
34:32
at this rate yuri might as well be
34:34
having conversation with the rock
34:38
come on luca
34:45
really
34:47
i wouldn't have expected you that yuri
34:50
but someone as gentle as you you
34:53
i guess you could say that
34:55
but if a story makes me think what takes
34:57
me to another world then
34:59
i really can't put it down
35:01
surreal horror is often very successful
35:03
at changing the way you look at the
35:05
world
35:05
only for a brief moment
35:13
i hate horror
35:15
oh why is that
35:16
well i just
35:19
nasty's eyes start over to me for a
35:21
split second
35:23
never mind
35:26
since soon
35:31
[Music]
35:32
that's right
35:37
like you usually like to write about
35:40
cute things don't you natsuki
35:44
what
35:45
what gives you that idea
35:48
you left a piece of scrap paper behind
35:50
last club meeting
35:52
it looked like you were working on a
35:53
poem called
35:54
don't say it out loud and give that back
35:58
i'm f but fine fine
36:02
your cupcakes your poems
36:04
everything you do it's just as cute as
36:07
you are
36:09
so yuri slides uh settles
36:13
that's supposed to be slides slides up
36:14
behind natsuki and puts her hand on her
36:16
shoulders
36:19
i'm not cute
36:23
natsuki you uh write your own poems
36:29
well
36:30
i guess sometimes
36:33
why do you care
36:35
i've always cared
36:37
i'm joking
36:38
i'm i think that's impressive
36:44
why don't you share them sometime
36:49
no
36:51
not
36:53
natsuki advertise
36:55
you wouldn't like them
36:58
ah
36:58
not a very confident writer yet
37:01
i understand how natsuki feels
37:03
sharing that level of writing takes more
37:05
than just confidence
37:07
the truest form of writing is writing to
37:09
oneself
37:11
you must be willing to open up to your
37:12
readers exposing your fun
37:14
vulnerabilities
37:16
and and showing even the deepest reaches
37:19
of your heart
37:21
do you have a ryan's experience too yuri
37:24
i i i don't know what monica sounds like
37:26
i can't imagine it
37:31
i'm trying to think
37:34
[Music]
37:41
mr belly girl
37:42
[Music]
37:44
uh
37:45
do you have
37:46
writing experience too
37:48
yuri
37:50
maybe if you share some of your work
37:53
you can set an example and help natsuki
37:56
feel comfortable enough to share hers
38:02
that does not i guess it's the same for
38:04
yuri
38:05
oh
38:06
i wanted to read everyone's poems
38:09
we all sat in silence for a moment
38:12
okay
38:14
i i have an idea
38:16
everyone huh
38:19
that's kind yuri looked quizzically
38:21
and monica
38:23
let's all go home and write a poem of
38:25
our own
38:26
the next time
38:27
we meet we'll all share
38:30
we'll all share them with each other
38:33
oh wait everyone is even
38:35
um
38:37
yeah let's do it
38:39
plus now that we have a new member i
38:41
think we'll
38:42
help us all get
38:44
ah [ __ ] you monica
38:47
help us all get a little more
38:49
comfortable with each other and
38:50
strengthen the part of the club
38:55
isn't that right luca
38:58
monica smiles warmly at me once again
39:02
hold on
39:03
there's still one more problem
39:06
huh
39:07
what's that
39:10
now that we're back to the original
39:12
topic of me joining the club i bluntly
39:14
come forth and
39:16
with what's been on my mind the entire
39:17
time
39:19
i never said i would join a club
39:21
so you already ma
39:23
you already may have convinced me to
39:24
stop by but i never made it
39:26
never made a decision
39:28
i still have all the clubs to look at
39:30
and um
39:34
oh
39:35
oh no
39:39
i lose my train of thought
39:43
both the voices and the acting is on
39:45
point it's scary
39:47
all the fall all the four girls stand
39:49
back at me with ejected eyes
39:53
what
39:55
oh i'm sorry
39:57
i
39:58
i
40:03
look huh
40:05
you all
40:07
i'm defenseless against these girls
40:10
how am i supposed to make a clear-headed
40:12
decision when it's like this
40:15
that is if writing poems is the prize i
40:18
need to pay in order to spend every day
40:19
with these
40:22
beautiful
40:23

that you respect

up and down

45:50
welcome to the literature club

46:07
about a poem to bring to the next
46:08

46:17
monica looks uh over at me once more
46:21
uh luca i look forward to seeing how you
46:25
express yourself
46:30
yeah
46:32
can i really impress the class down
46:33
monica with my mediocre writing skills
46:36
i already feel the anxiety welling up
46:39
inside me
46:44
meanwhile the girls continue to
46:45
chit-chat as yuri natsuki clean up their
46:47
food
46:48
food
46:50
uh hey luka um
46:53
since we're already here
46:57
do you want to walk home together
46:59
oh that's right
47:01
sayori and i never walk home together
47:03
anymore because she's always staying
47:04
after after school for clubs
47:08

47:09
might as well
47:10
yeah
47:13

47:17

47:50
be happy spending every day after school

47:56
closer to one of these girls
47:59

48:01
i just need to make the most of my
48:02
circumstances and i'm sure good fortune

60:15
that i thought you might enjoy

60:19
it should keep your attention even if
60:21

61:21

61:25
now that everyone's settled in i expect
61:28
monica to kick off some scheduled
61:29
activities for the club but that doesn't
61:31
seem to be the case
61:33
a sayori and monica having a cheery
61:35
conversation in the corner
61:37
yuri's face is already buried in a
61:39
bucket i can't help but notice her
61:41
intense expression like she was waiting
61:43
for this chance
61:44
meanwhile natsuki is rummaging around
61:47
the closet
61:49
cyan with a
61:51

62:00
yuri
62:01
a little bit more
62:03
at the same time
62:05
i would feel bad for distracting her
62:07
from reading
62:08
i
62:09
catch a glimpse of the cover of her book
62:12
it
62:13
looks like the same bug that she learned
62:14
to me
62:15

62:17
very first
62:19

she sneaks another glance at me and her
62:54
eyes meet

guys go like it
67:17
[Music]
67:19
i see
67:20
there's something fairly obvious here
67:22
that yuri isn't telling me but i decide
67:24
to let it go
67:25
i'll definitely start reading it soon
67:29
i'm glad to hear
67:30
once it starts to pick up
67:33
you might have a hard time putting it
67:34
down
67:36
it's a very engaging and relatable story
67:39
is that so
67:41
what's it about anyway
67:43
well
67:44
[Music]
67:46
yuri closes the book and scans her eyes
67:48
over the back
67:49
the book is titled portrait of markov
67:53
[Music]
67:56
there's an ominous looking eye symbol on
67:58
the front cover
68:00
all right
68:02
i just wanted to make sure i don't
68:03
accidentally give anything away
68:06
basically it's about this girl in high
68:08
school who moves in with her long-lost
68:10
brother younger sister
68:12
but as soon as she does
68:14
her life gets really strange
68:16
she gets targeted by these people who
68:18
escape from a human experimental
68:20
prison
68:22
welcome back
68:24
and while her life is in danger she
68:27
needs to desperately choose who to trust
68:30
no matter what she does she ends up
68:32
destroying most of her relationships and
68:34
her
68:34
life starts to fall apart
68:37
that that's kind of
68:41
it's kind of dark isn't it
68:43
[Music]
68:44
yuri made it sound like it was going to
68:46
be a nice story so a dark time
68:48
came from nowhere
68:50
[Music]
68:55
hmm
68:59
are you not a fan of that sort of thing
69:00
luca
69:01
no it's not that
69:06
i mean i can definitely enjoy these kind
69:08
of stories so don't worry
69:10
i hope so
69:11
yeah i totally forgot that yuri's
69:13
instant into those things
69:15
she's
69:15
she's so shy
69:18
and reclusive on the outside but her
69:19
mind seems to be completely different
69:22
it's just that those kinds of stories
69:25
they challenge you to look at life from
69:27
a strange new perspective
69:31
when horrible things happen not just
69:33
because someone wants to be evil
69:35
but because they have their own goals
69:38
or their own philosophy that they
69:40
believe in
69:42
and suddenly when you
69:44
what is she talking about
69:47
point related to the protagonist they
69:49
made it out to be the naive one
69:52
we're letting one their one-sided morals
69:54
interfere with the villain's plans
69:56
i'm i'm rambling aren't i
69:59
not again
70:01
i'm sorry
70:03
hey don't apologize
70:05
i haven't lost interest or anything
70:08
well
70:09
i guess it's all right then
70:11
i feel like i should let you know that i
70:12
have this problem
70:14
and i let things like books and writing
70:18
fill my thoughts
70:19
i kind of forgot to pay attention to
70:21
other people
70:23
so i'm sorry if i end up saying
70:24
something strange
70:26
[Music]
70:28
um
70:30
[Music]
70:33
and please stop me if i start talking
70:36
too much
70:38
that's
70:39
i really don't think you need to worry
70:42
that just means you're passionate about
70:43
reading
70:45
the least i can do is listen
70:47
it's a literature club after all
70:51
and
70:52
well that's true
70:54
in fact
70:55
i might as well get started reading it
70:57
oh i might as well get started reading
70:59
it right
71:01
you don't have to
71:03
[Music]
71:05
what are you saying
71:06
just a moment ago you were looking
71:08
forward to it
71:10
let me just get the book
71:12
i quickly retrieved the book
71:14
that i had to put into my bag
71:17
all right
71:18
it's fine if i sit here right
71:23
[Music]
71:34
i slip into the seat next to yuri's
71:39
yeah
71:41
are you sure
71:42
you seem a little apprehensive
71:45
that that's
71:47
i'm sorry
71:50
it's not that i don't want you to
71:52
it's just something i'm not very used to
71:55
that is really in company with someone
71:58
well you're about to find out
72:01
i see
72:02
well just tell me

i opened the book it's not the prologue
72:14
i still understand what yuri means about
72:16
reading and company

72:19

72:21
over my shoulders i read

81:14
and they called me hey luca

okay let's continue
83:35
[Music]
83:44
yuri's in the corner of my eye
83:46
[Music]
83:49
i realize that she's not actually
83:51
looking at her book
83:52
i glanced over
83:55
it looks like she's reading from my book
83:57
instead
84:02
sorry
84:05
i i was just
84:06
[Music]
84:09
yuri
84:10
you really apologize a lot don't you
84:13

84:17
satori thanks so much for the three
84:18
dollars

84:37
[Music]
84:43
oh man
84:45
[Music]
84:49
oh god
84:50
[Music]
84:55
oh
84:56

84:58
please have some what i do i do i have
85:00
some
85:00
[Music]
85:03
get the fedora
85:05
okay
85:07
yuri you really do apologize a lot don't
85:09
you
85:10
uh i do but i don't really mean to
85:14
sorry
85:16
i mean
85:19
yeah
85:21
it should work right
85:23
i slide my desk until it's
85:25
up against yuri's and hold my book more
85:27
between the two of them
85:30
[Music]
85:40
suppose so
85:41
[Music]
85:42
yuri timidly closes her
85:45
copy
85:47
once we once we each lean in a little
85:49
bit our shoulders are almost touching
85:52
it feels like my left arm is in the way
85:54
so so instead
85:56
i use my right hand to hold the book
85:58
open
86:00
uh i guess that makes it kind of
86:03
difficult to turn a page
86:05
here
86:10
[Music]
86:19
oh
86:23
yuri chad
86:26
[Music]
86:31
yuri takes her left arm and holds the
86:33
left side
86:35
of the book
86:37
between her thumb and forefinger this is
86:40
it that's what it looks like
86:42
that's me guys it's my hand
86:44
look
86:45
[Music]
86:53
uh
86:55
i did the same with my right right arm
86:57
on the right side of the book
86:58
that way i turn a page when you re-slide
87:00
it on the thumb
87:02
after it flips to her side
87:05
but in holding it like this
87:07
we're huddled even closer than before
87:10
it's actually kind of
87:12
distracting me
87:14
it's that so if i can feel the warmth of
87:16
yuri's face
87:18
as she's in the corner of my vision
87:23
she's looking at us chad
87:25
are you ready
87:26
[Music]
87:29
to turn the page
87:30
oh sorry
87:34
i think i got a little bit of distracted
87:36
for a second
87:37
i glanced over yuri's face and her eyes
87:39
met
87:40
[Music]
87:43
i don't know how i'll be able to keep up
87:45
with her
87:46
[Music]
87:47
that's okay she's smiling
87:50
[Music]
87:54
you know you're not as used to reading
87:56
right
87:57
i don't mind being patient if it takes
87:58
you a little bit longer longer
88:01
it's probably the least i can do
88:03
since you've been so patient with me
88:06
yeah
88:08
thanks
88:09
[Music]
88:10
peachy you're too beautiful
88:13
thank you so much for the time thank you
88:15
i appreciate that
88:16
we continue reading yuri no longer asks
88:19
me if i'm ready to turn the page
88:22
instead i assume that she finishes the
88:24
page before me so i turn it by my own
88:26
volition
88:28
we continue the first chapter in silence
88:30
even sir turning each page almost feels
88:33
like an intimate exchange
88:35
what the [ __ ] am i talking about
88:37
my thumb gently
88:39
letting go of the page letting it
88:41
flutter over to her side as she catches
88:44
it
88:44
under her own thumb
88:48
[Music]
88:49
hey yuri
88:52
this might be a silly thought but
88:54
the main character kind of reminds me of
88:56
you a little bit
88:58
you think so
89:00
how does she
89:02
well i guess she's more
89:03
blunt in a lot of ways
89:05
but she also second guesses all of the
89:07
things that she says and does like she's
89:10
afraid she'll do something
89:13
it's not like i can see into your head
89:14
or anything
89:15
but they're kind of reminiscent of some
89:17
of your mannerisms
89:19
i see
89:22
[Music]
89:25
yuri remains silent for a moment
89:28
but luca
89:30
that's probably
89:31
a terrible thing to have in common with
89:33
her
89:34
oh that's so embarrassing that you think
89:36
that
89:38
wait wait
89:40
i didn't mean it in a bad way or
89:42
anything
89:43
i'm sorry i really didn't know you were
89:45
self-conscious about that sort of thing
89:49
i guess i'm all mad that it's kind of
89:51
cute
89:55
what are you saying all of a sudden
89:58
okay everyone
90:02
i think it's about time we share today's
90:04
poems with each other
90:06
you might not have a lot of enough time
90:08
for way too long
90:13
is that all right yuri
90:14
you look kind of down
90:16
[Music]
90:17
i'm sorry if you haven't been looking
90:18
forward to this
90:20
it's not
90:22
it's fine
90:24
yuri releases her hand from the book
90:26
causing it to close on top of my thumb
90:30
alright
90:31
i guess i'll do some more reading
90:32
tonight or would you prefer that i only
90:36
read it with you
90:37
um
90:39
i guess i don't have too much
90:41
of a preference anyway
90:44
hmm
90:46
in that case i'll why
90:49
why
90:50
i'll read a little more i'll read a
90:52
little more tonight
90:53
[Music]
90:56
it'll be
90:57
it'll be more fun to read but the year
90:59
after it picks up a bit you know
91:03
that's good reasoning
91:05
in that case feel free to finish the two
91:08
chapters
91:09
the first few chapters in
91:11
your own time
91:12
all right
91:13
i stand up i make a mental note of where
91:16
i left off in the book and slip it back
91:18
onto my back
91:19
uh by the way
91:21
like did you remember to write a poem
91:23
last night
91:24
yeah
91:25
my relaxation ends i can't believe i
91:28
agreed to something to do something
91:29
embarrassing
91:31
i couldn't really find much inspiration
91:34
since i've never really done this before
91:37
well
91:38
now that everyone's ready
91:40
how do you find someone to share with
91:43
i can't wait
91:44
[Music]
91:49
sayori and monica enthusiastically pulls
91:52
out their poems
91:54
sayori's is on a wrinkled sheet of loose
91:56
leaf torn from a spiral notebook
91:59
on the other hand monika wrote hers in
92:02
the compositions what's the difference i
92:05
i don't know what these are
92:09
i can
92:10
i can already see monica's pristine
92:13
handwriting west but where i sit
92:17
natsuki and yuri reluctantly compliance
92:19
while
92:20
reaching into their bags
92:22
i do the same myself
92:26
who should i show my poem first
92:31
let's let's show natsuki first yeah
92:35
i told natsuki i was interested in the
92:37
poems yesterday
92:39
it's probably only fair if i shared mine
92:40
with her first
92:42
[Music]
92:45
huh
92:46
well
92:47
it's about what i expected
92:49
from someone like you
92:52
that's
92:53
a little blunt
92:55
oh excuse me
92:58
it's not like i said it was bad
93:01
it just didn't evoke any emotions
93:05
so basically it's not cute enough your
93:07
tastes
93:08
you wanna get smacked
93:14
i don't know why but she reminds me of
93:16
reimu

95:20
yeah
95:20
i don't even like it
95:24
i like it
95:26
what just be honest
95:29
i i am
95:31
why are you so convinced that i wouldn't
95:32
like it
95:34
silly with a five dollars i have a poem
95:35
for you boss put your boob inside all i
95:37
need is your smile wherever you whenever
95:40

96:09
okay
96:11
thanks
96:14
thanks celine
96:15
[Music]
96:17
well
96:18
because
96:21
everyone in high school
96:23
thinks that mining has to be all
96:24
sophisticated and stuff
96:26
so
96:27
people don't even take my writing
96:29
seriously
96:31
but isn't that the point of poems for
96:33
people to express themselves
96:35
your writing style wouldn't make your
96:36
any would it make your message any less
96:38
valid
96:40
yes
96:41
exactly
96:42
i like it when it's easy to read but it
96:44
hits you hard
96:46
like in this poem
96:48
seeing everyone around and you do great
96:51
do great things
96:52
can be really disheartening
96:55
so i decided to write about it
96:57
yeah i understand
96:59
ken's red just caught up it's a lot
97:02
up to live but i'm watching from
97:04
queensland
97:06
brought you a comment from a hot room in
97:08
my soul
97:10
you can't drive it at 10 bucks thank you
97:14
oh my god
97:16
fog
97:18
i'm glad you're here
97:19
[Music]
97:22
yeah i understand
97:25
but
97:27
the other nice thing about simple
97:28
writing is that it puts more weight on
97:30
the workplace
97:32
like i set up for a rhyme at the end but
97:35
then made it up for all flat on purpose
97:38
it helps bring out the feeling in the
97:40
last line
97:43
so you did
97:45
you liar you said it sucks i guess
97:47
more went into it than i realized
97:50
that's what i mean or that's what it
97:52
means to be a pro
97:54
i'm glad you learned something
97:56
didn't ex didn't expect that from the
97:57
youngest one here did you
97:59
yeah guess not i decided to humor her
98:02
with the last comment
98:05
i don't really care how old everyone is
98:07
but if not he's feeling proud then
98:09
okay
98:10
[Music]
98:13
okay yuri yuri
98:18
as yuri reads the poem i notice her eyes
98:21
lighten
98:23
exceptional
98:27
what was that
98:30
did i say that out loud
98:32
yuri first covers her mouth and ends up
98:35
covering her face
98:41
[Music]
98:44
he's going to hate me
98:46
um
98:48
you really didn't do anything wrong yuri
98:53
that's
98:54
i guess you're right
98:56
what am i getting nervous for
99:00
mary takes a breath
99:04
so
99:05
what kind of writing experience that you
99:07
have
99:08
your use of imagery and metaphors
99:10
indicates that you've written a lot of
99:12
poetry before
99:15
really really
99:16
[Music]
99:17
pcs
99:19
yeah absolutely absolute cutest please
99:21
keep being yourself i have to go now but
99:22
you're so fun to watch boss thank you so
99:24
much have fun have a lovely night sleep
99:27
well have a lovely day thank you for
99:29
three dollars too thank you
99:34
really
99:35
[Music]
99:37
well that's a huge compliment from you
99:40
this is actually my first time really
99:42
huh
99:45
yuri stands at me blankly then looks at
99:46
my poem again
99:49
well
99:50
i know that
99:51
i just meant um
99:54
yuri trails off unable to find us an
99:56
excuse
99:57
she traces her fingers a lot along the
100:00
words of the poem as if breaking it down
100:02
more thoroughly
100:04
ah
100:05
okay
100:07
this is the reason i was able to tell
100:10
it's just
100:11
that there are specific writing habits
100:13
that are usually typical of new writers
100:15
and having been through that myself i
100:17
kind of learned to pick up on them
100:19
i think the most noticeable thing i
100:21
recognize then
100:24
reading talk
100:27
god
100:30
in other words they tend to pick up a
100:32
writing style separate from the topic
100:34
matter and they form fit two together
100:37
[Music]
100:39
the end result is that both of the style
100:41
and expressiveness are weakened
100:44
once yuri finds her train of thought
100:47
it's as if her demeanor totally changes
100:52
her stammering is completely gone
100:54
and she sounds like an expert
100:58
of course that's not something you can
101:00
be blamed for
101:01
there's so many different skills and
101:02
techniques that go into writing even
101:04
even a simple poem
101:06
not just finding them and building them
101:09
but getting them to work together is
101:11
probably the most challenging part
101:14
you might take
101:16
i need water guys
101:18
whoa
101:21
holy
101:23
it might take you some time but it all
101:24
comes with practice and learning by
101:26
example and trying new things
101:28
i also hope that
101:30
everyone else in the club gives you
101:32
valuable feedback
101:34
natsuki can be a little bit biased
101:36
though
101:37
biased hell
101:38
um
101:39
well
101:40
never mind
101:42
i shouldn't be talking about people like
101:43
that
101:44
sorry it's fine
101:47
i'm not sure if yuri is apologizing to
101:49
us off
101:50
what's natsuki
101:53
do you mind if i read your poem now
101:55
please do
101:58
i'd love to share my thought process
101:59
behind it
102:01
yuri smiles streamingly as if that's a
102:03
rare opportunity for her
102:05
which itself is kind of funny
102:08
after all
102:09
isn't this supposed to be a literature
102:11
club
102:14
tosh thank you so much
102:16
i'm glad
102:18
okay
102:20
ghost
102:21
under the light
102:23
the tendrils of my
102:25
lair
102:26
eliminate beneath the amber color
102:29
bathing it must be
102:32
this one
102:33
this last remaining street light to lav
102:37
withstood the test of time
102:39
the last yet to be replaced by the
102:41
sickening blue green liu of the future
102:45
i bathe
102:46
calms breathing
102:48
air of the present but living in the
102:51
past
102:52
the light flickers
102:53
i flick it back
102:59
okay i didn't really understand but
103:03
it's the thought that counts guys
103:05
there
103:13
tendrils of my
103:16
of my hair
103:20
oh
103:23
whoops
103:26
it looks like an l
103:29
[Music]
103:36
i'm sorry i have such terrible
103:38
handwriting how do you know how do you
103:40
know
103:43
what
103:45
i wasn't thinking that at all
103:48
[Music]
103:49
but it took you a long time to read
103:53
uh
103:55
well i just don't read scripts very
103:58
often
103:58
i actually think your handwriting is
104:00
pretty
104:01
huh
104:03
good morning luca
104:04
hi thank you thank you krom
104:07
that's a relief that's a relief
104:09
i also like the poem even though it's
104:11
short it was it was really descriptive
104:14
it wasn't too short
104:16
i usually write longer poems
104:18
not at all
104:20
[Music]
104:22
i'm really glad you like it
104:23
i'll be honest
104:25
oh i'll be honest it's our first time
104:27
sharing i wanted to write something a
104:29
little more mild
104:30
something easy to digest i suppose
104:33
are you into ghosts yuri
104:36
actually the story isn't about a curse
104:38
at all luca
104:39
really
104:40
i must have totally missed the point
104:43
well well i suppose you did only glance
104:45
over after all
104:47
but remember that poets often express
104:50
their own thoughts feelings and
104:51
experiences in their work
104:53
they usually do more than tell a simple
104:55
story or paint a picture
104:57
in this case perhaps the subject of the
104:59
poem is only being symbolically compared
105:02
to a ghost ah i get i see i see i
105:04
understand i understand all this i
105:08
understand all this talk
105:11
lingering in our last remaining place of
105:13
comfort unable to let go of the past and
105:16
soon to be left with nothing that's a
105:18
lot more solemn putting it away in that
105:20
way
105:21
i hadn't even thought of that
105:23
but
105:24
that's impressive
105:27
it's nothing really
105:29
yours was impressive too
105:33
if anything i could have probably
105:34
learned a thing from
105:35
thing or two from you
105:37
you think so
105:38
yeah of course
105:40
oh
105:41
you know
105:42
i was really nervous about doing all
105:44
this
105:44
but in the end i enjoyed it
105:46
i'm going to keep doing my best for you
105:48
luca
105:49
uh
105:50
me too
105:54
guys sayori
105:59
[Music]
106:01
this is a good poem luka
106:03
are you sure it's like are you sure it's
106:05
your first time
106:06
of course
106:08
it's not that good
106:09
am i the kind of guy who would be
106:11
writing poems in his spare time
106:14
i guess you're right
106:16
but that's why it surprised me
106:18
well to be honest
106:20
i was afraid that you wouldn't do it
106:22
seriously
106:23
well you wouldn't write one at all i'm
106:26
really happy that you just wrote one
106:28
it just reminds me of how you're really
106:30
part of the club now
106:33
not to mention the fact that i'm
106:34
standing in front of you in the club
106:36
room
106:37
uh well of course i'm not really into it
106:40
yet but that just doesn't mean that
106:42
doesn't mean i'll break my promise
106:45
see
106:47
it's like i said before luca
106:49
deep down you're not selfish at all you
106:51
know
106:52
trying new things like this for other
106:54
people
106:55
that's something that's only really good
106:58
people do
106:59
thanks sayori
107:00
i'm not sure if sayori sees the full
107:02
picture of my mother here
107:04
is his throat okay my throat is fine
107:07
[Music]
107:10
then again
107:11
i can't deny that she's part of the
107:13
reason i joined
107:14

107:16
all
107:17

107:43
dear sunshine
107:46
the way you glow through my blinds in
107:47
the morning it makes me feel like you
107:49
missed me
107:51
kissing my forehead you helped me out of
107:53
bed
107:54
making me rob the sleepy from my eyes
107:57
what is a sleepy
108:00
are you asking me to come out up and
108:02
play are you trusting me to wish away
108:04
the rain a rainy day
108:07
i look above
108:09
the sky is blue it's a secret but i
108:12
trust you too

[Music]
109:19
sayori
109:21
[Music]
109:22
this is a guess but
109:25
did you wait until morning to write this
109:28
no
109:29
[Music]
109:31
just a little bit
109:33
but you can't answer just a little bit
109:35
oh you gotta answer this a little bit uh
109:37
yes another question
109:39
i forgot to do it last night
109:41
well at least that makes me feel a
109:43
little better about myself
109:44
don't be mean
109:46
i still tried my best
109:49
uh yeah
109:51
i didn't mean to say that it was a bad
109:53
poem
109:54
it came out nice oh how should i put it
109:57
it sounds just like you
109:59
really
110:01
yeah
110:03
especially that last line
110:05
i made accent toast
110:08
even though you were late to school it's
110:10
bad
110:11
it's bad to skip breakfast
110:16
i get all cranky
110:18
oh well i guess there's no point in
110:20
arguing
110:21
anyway thanks for showing me
110:25
this was so much fun
110:26
monica's the best
110:28
uh yeah
110:30
but next time i won't forget
110:32
and i'm gonna write the best poem ever
110:36
well i guess i look forward to it
110:43
monica
110:45
how long is this game guys
110:48
hi luca
110:50
having a good time so far
110:52
uh yeah
110:54
good glad to hear it
110:56
by the way like
110:58
since
110:59
you knew and everything
111:01
if you ever have any suggestions for the
111:03
club like new activities or things we
111:05
can do better
111:06
i'm always listening
111:08
don't be afraid to bring things up okay
111:11
all right i'll keep that in mind
111:13
of course of course i'll be afraid to
111:15
bring things up i'm much better off just
111:18
going with the flow until most very long
111:20
15 plus hours what
111:24
anyway anyway
111:26
want to share your poem with me
111:28
it's kind of embarrassing but i guess i
111:29
have to
111:32
don't worry luka
111:35
we're all a little embarrassed today you
111:36
know
111:37
but
111:39
it's that sort of barrier that we'll
111:40
learn to get past soon
111:43
yeah that's true
111:45
i had my i hand my monika my poem
111:48
[Music]
111:51
great job luca
111:53
i was going ooh
111:54
in my head while reading it
111:57
it's really metaphorical
112:00
i'm not sure why but i didn't expect you
112:02
to go for something so deep
112:05
i guess i underestimated you
112:07
it's easy for me to keep everyone's
112:09
expectations
112:11
that way it always counts when i put in
112:13
some effort
112:16
that's not very fair of you
112:18
well well i guess it worked anyway
112:21
you know that you really like this kind
112:23
of
112:24
kind of writing right
112:26
writing's that
112:27
writing that's full of imaginary and
112:29
symbolism
112:31
unlike sayori who likes using simple and
112:33
direct words to describe happiness and
112:35
sadness
112:36
he really likes it when readers are left
112:38
to derive their own
112:40
why are we talking about yuri
112:43
eating out of it
112:45
it's very challenging to write
112:48
like that effectively
112:52
both allowing people to get something
112:54
out of it
112:57
[Music]
112:58
duh
112:59
just by feel
113:01
or letting them deeply analyze all the
113:03
nuances
113:05
it can take years of practice which i'm
113:08
assuming yuri hasn't
113:10
oh you talk way too much
113:14
at this point
113:15
[Music]
113:16
i never really asked though
113:18
i'm i'm sure i'm nowhere near the hell
113:21
level yet
113:23
ah
113:25
wow how long have we been live
113:28
not even two hours
113:30
[ __ ]
113:31
[Music]
113:36
oh
113:37
don't worry so much about that
113:38
you do your own thing
113:40
just keep exploring and learn by trying
113:42
new things
113:44
i'm i'm sure i'll end up trying
113:46
different things a lot
113:48
it could take a while before i feel
113:50
comfortable doing this
113:51
that's okay
113:53
i'd love to see you try new things
113:55
what's the best way to find the kind of
113:57
style that suits you
113:59
everyone else might be a little biased
114:02
towards
114:03
your own kinds of styles
114:05
but always help you find what suits you
114:07
the most
114:08
so don't force yourself to ride the way
114:10
everyone else wants you right
114:13
it's like it's not like you have to
114:14
worry about impressing them or anything
114:16
ah actually i want to impress yuri
114:20
uh huh
114:24
anyway you want to read my poem now
114:28
don't worry i'm not very good
114:30
you sound pretty confident for someone
114:32
who claims to not be very good
114:34
[Music]
114:35
well
114:36
that's because i have to sound confident
114:39
that doesn't mean i always feel that way
114:41
you know
114:42
i see
114:44
well let's read it then
114:51
hole
114:52
in the wall
114:54
it couldn't have been me
114:56
see
114:56
the direction that spackle protrudes a
114:59
noisy neighbor
115:02
an angry boyfriend
115:03
i'll never know i wasn't home
115:06
i peer inside for a clue no
115:08
i can't see
115:10
i real
115:11
blind like a film left out in the sun
115:15
but it's too late
115:16
my redness already scorched with a
115:19
permanent copy of my meaningless image
115:25
it's just a little hole
115:26
it wasn't too bright
115:28
it was too deep
115:30
stretching forever into everything
115:32
a hole with infinite choices
115:35
i realize now that i wasn't looking in i
115:38
was looking out
115:40
and he
115:41
on the other side
115:42
was looking
115:44
in
115:46
hog
115:48
fog
115:50
nice
115:53
i don't understand
115:56
so what do you think
115:58
um it's very free form if that that's
116:00
what you call it
116:02
sorry i'm not really the right person
116:06
to ask for feedback
116:08
it's okay
116:09
yeah that kind of style has gotten
116:11
pretty popular nowadays
116:13
that is a lot of poems have been putting
116:15
emphasis on the timing between words and
116:17
times
116:18
when performed out loud it can be really
116:21
powerful
116:22
what was the
116:24
inspiration behind this one again
116:26
uh well
116:29
i'm not sure if i know how to put it
116:32
i guess
116:33
you could say that i had some kind of
116:35
epiphany recently
116:37
it's been influencing my poems a little
116:40
bit
116:41
an epiphany what does that mean
116:44
yeah something like that
116:46
i'm kind of strong
116:48
i'm kind of nervous no i'm kind of
116:50
nervous to talk about deep stuff like
116:52
that because it's kind of coming on
116:54
strongly
116:55
maybe after everyone is friends with
116:57
each other
116:58
anyway
117:00
here's monica's lining tip of the day
117:03
sometimes when you're writing a poem or
117:05
a story your brain gets too fixated on a
117:08
specific
117:09
point
117:10
if you try to
117:15
if you try so hard to make it perfect
117:18
then you'll never make any progress
117:21
just force yourself to get something
117:23
down on the paper and tidy it up later
117:26
another way to think about it
117:28
is this
117:31
if you keep your pen in the same spot
117:33
for too long
117:34
you'll just end up in a big dark puddle
117:36
of ink
117:38
so
117:39
just move your hand
117:41
and go with the flow
117:43
that's my advice for today
117:45
thanks for listening
117:53
i guess that's everyone
117:57
i glanced around the room
117:59
that was a little more stressful than i
118:00
anticipated
118:02
it's as if everyone is judging me for my
118:04
mediocre writing skills
118:06
even if they're just being nice there's
118:08
no way my poems poems can stand up to
118:11
this
118:12
this is a literature club after all
118:15
ah
118:17
i guess that's what i ended up
118:19
getting myself into
118:21
across the room sayori monika are
118:24
happily chatting
118:26
my eyes land on yuri and natsuki
118:29
hey genuine
118:31
gingerly
118:32
exchange sheets of paper shaking
118:36
do they hate each other or something i
118:37
feel like they do
118:40
as they read in tandem i watch each of
118:43
their expressions change
118:45
natsuki's eyebrows photo and frustration
118:48
meanwhile yuri smiles
118:51
sadly
118:56
why sad
118:58
what's with this language
119:01
did you say something
119:03
oh it's nothing
119:05
natsuki dismissively returns the poem on
119:07
the task with one hand
119:09
i guess you could call it nancy
119:13
uh thanks
119:15
versus cute
119:17
cute
119:19
did you completely miss the symbolism or
119:22
something
119:23
it's clearly about the feeling of giving
119:25
up
119:26
how can that be cute
119:28
i know that i just meant
119:31
a language i guess
119:33
i was trying to say something nice
119:37
you mean you have to try that hard to
119:39
come up with something nice
119:44
to say
119:45
thanks but it really didn't come out
119:47
nice at all
119:50
oh
119:52
[ __ ]
119:55
well
119:56
i do have a couple of suggestions
120:00
um
120:02
if i was looking for suggestions i would
120:04
have asked someone who actually liked it
120:10
which people did by the way
120:14
sayori liked it
120:16
and look at the two
120:19
oh my god natsuki
120:20
so facing that
120:22
i'll gladly give you some suggestions of
120:24
my own
120:25
first of all
120:27
um
120:28
excuse me
120:30
i appreciate the offer but i've spent a
120:32
long time establishing my writing style
120:36
i don't expect it to change anytime soon
120:38
unless of course
120:40
i come across something particularly
120:43
inspiring
120:45
which i haven't yet
120:50
and luca liked my poem too you know
120:53
he even told me he was impressed by it
120:58
natsuki suddenly stands up
121:01
oh
121:04
i didn't realize you were so invested in
121:07
trying to impress a new member yuri
121:10
what is going on
121:15
that's not what i
121:17
uh
121:19
you're
121:20
just stands up as well
121:24
maybe you're just jealous that look he
121:25
appreciates my advice more than he
121:27
appreciated yours
121:29
huh
121:30
and how do you know you didn't
121:32
appreciate my advice more
121:34
are you that full of yourself
121:38
no
121:39
if i was full of myself
121:41
i would have i would deliberately go out
121:43
of my way to make
121:45
everything
121:47
i do overly cutesy
121:54
um
121:55
is everyone okay
121:57
well you know what
121:59
i wasn't the one whose boobs magically
122:02
grew
122:03
what the [ __ ]
122:05
tragically grew a size bigger as soon as
122:07
lucas started showing up
122:10
natsuki
122:13
um
122:14
natsuki that's a little
122:19
this doesn't involve you
122:24
oh my god what the hell is going on guys
122:26
they're fighting over me
122:28
who is the same now chat
122:31
[ __ ] y'all
122:32
who's the sim now huh
122:34
huh
122:36
not me
122:37
[Laughter]
122:43
i don't like finding guys
122:46
suddenly
122:48
both girls turned towards
122:50
both girls turned towards me as if they
122:52
just noticed i was standing there
122:56
luca
122:58
she's just trying to make me look bad
123:02
that's not true
123:04
she started it
123:07
if she could get over herself and learn
123:09
to appreciate the simple writing is more
123:11
effective then this wouldn't have
123:13
happened in the first place
123:15
what's the point in making your poems
123:18
all convoluted for no reason
123:20
the meaning should just jump out of the
123:22
out of the reader
123:24
not force them to have to figure it out
123:26
figure it out
123:28
help me explain that to her look up
123:33
wait
123:35
there's a reason we have so many deep
123:37
and expressive words in the language
123:40
it's only it's the only way to convey
123:42
complex feelings and meanings the most
123:45
effectively
123:47
avoiding them is not only unnecessary
123:49
limiting limiting yourself
123:51
it's also a waste
123:53
you understand that too
123:55
right luca why the [ __ ] are you bringing
123:57
me into this
123:59
don't make me pick
124:01
um
124:02
well
124:04
well
124:06
[Music]
124:08
how did i get dragged into this in the
124:11
first place
124:13
it's not like i know anything about
124:15
writing
124:16
but who
124:17
whoever i agree with
124:19
they'll probably think more highly of me
124:22
so of course
124:24
that's going to be
124:25
[Music]
124:27
ah
124:29
[Music]
124:37
which one
124:42
i'm not gonna [ __ ] out
124:44
help me sayori no
124:46
that's gonna make both of them hate me
124:49
at the same time making sayori look at
124:51
me and be like
124:57
man up
125:01
but if i go with yuri
125:04
since we already have like you know a
125:06
little connection going on
125:08
guys
125:12
i might get myself a girlfriend tonight
125:15
bog
125:26
oh we can save
125:33
[Music]
125:34
yuri
125:37
natsuki
125:49
i didn't pick the wrong one i didn't
125:53
you're right that i liked your poem
125:56
see
125:58
wait
125:59
that's not an excuse for you to be so
126:01
mean
126:03
you shouldn't pick a fight just because
126:05
someone's opinion is different
126:08
big man luca coming in
126:10
big mob boss lukaku
126:12
[Music]
126:14
it's not what happened at all
126:16
i really wouldn't even take my palms
126:18
seriously
126:21
um
126:22
i understand
126:25
yuri
126:26
[Music]
126:28
you're serious i got it i can't do it i
126:30
gotta do it
126:32
i gotta do it
126:34
you're seriously a talented writer
126:37
it's no secret that i was impressed
126:40
well
126:41
that's
126:42
but here's the thing no matter how
126:44
simple or refined someone's writing
126:46
style is
126:48
they're still putting feelings into it
126:50
and it becomes something
126:52
really
126:54
personal
126:56
that's why natsuki felt threatened when
126:59
you said her poem was cute
127:02
god i sound like a dweeb
127:08
i see
127:11
i didn't notice that at all
127:16
it's i sound like a dweeb
127:20
oh you sound you sound nice and why is
127:22
it
127:25
well aren't you
127:26
what
127:27
no
127:30
i'm sorry
127:34
bernotsky
127:36
you took it way too far
127:40
he took her way too far
127:43
jury means well
127:45
and if you just told her how you felt
127:47
then this wouldn't have happened in the
127:48
first place
127:50
are you kidding
127:52
that's exactly what i did it was her
127:54
death
127:56
natsuki
127:58
i think that's enough
128:00
you both said some things you did
128:02
that you didn't mean
128:04
you reapologized don't you think you
128:07
should too
128:08
[Music]
128:15
in the end no one has taken her side
128:18
she's trapped at this point of being
128:20
defiant only because she can't handle
128:22
the pressure
128:23
i end up feeling bad for her
128:26
um
128:28
sometimes when i'm hurt
128:31
it helps to take a walk and clear my
128:34
head
128:36
sayori she doesn't need to
128:38
you know what
128:39
you know what
128:42
i'm going to do that
128:43
it'll spare me from having to look at
128:45
all your faces now
128:48
without warning natsuki snatches an oran
128:50
pull him up from the desk and storms out
128:52
on her way out she crumples the poem no
128:57
[Music]
128:59
what the hell
129:04
not ski
129:06
she really didn't need to do that
129:10
[Music]
129:12
yuri has her chin buried in her hands
129:15
while she stands down at her desk i
129:18
gingerly approached her and she sent and
129:20
sit in an adjacent chair
129:25
everything everything all right i'm so
129:27
embarrassed
129:29
i can't believe i acted like that
129:30
i hope you hate me now
129:32
no yuri
129:34
how could i how could anyone not have
129:36

131:24
friends too
131:26
so
131:27
the poems will turn out even better
131:30
i think to myself
131:32
i did learn a little more about the
131:34
kinds of poems everyone
131:36
likes with any luck that means i can't i
131:40
can at least do a better job impressing
131:42
those i want to impress
131:43
i know to myself with newfound
131:45
determination
131:46
[Music]
131:48
luca
131:49
ready to walk home
131:52

131:55
sayori beams at me
131:58
it truly has been a while since sayori
132:00
and i have spent this much time together
132:02
i can't really say i mean
132:04
i can't really say i'm not enjoying it
132:05
either oh
132:07
yes
132:09
sayori
132:10
about what happened earlier
132:12
what do you mean
132:15
you know uh between yuri natsuki
132:18
does that kind of thing happen often
132:21
no no no no
132:23
this is really the first time i've seen
132:24
them fight like that
132:26
i promise they're both wonderful people
132:29
you don't you don't hate them do you
132:32

132:41
ew
132:42
you know luka it's nice that i could
132:44
spend the time with you at the club

132:53
what makes me the happiest
132:55

132:58
that's
133:01
every day is going to be so much fun

it looks like sayori still hasn't caught
133:07
on to that kind of situation i'm in
133:10
sure being friends with everyone is nice
133:12
but
133:14
does it really need to stop here
133:17

sayuri
133:22
ipad sayori on the shoulder
133:26
i said
133:27
i said i'm more to myself than her
133:32

133:33
internal monologue sometimes
133:36
okay
133:38
yeah
133:39
let's do this

uh
138:58
unstable
139:02
unstable
139:12

139:13
[Music]
139:14
anger
139:16
oh
139:22
ah
139:23
another day passes and it's time for the
139:27
club
139:28
meeting
139:29
already
139:33
i've gotten a little more comfortable
139:34
here over the past few days
139:37
entering the club room the usual scene
139:39
greets me
139:41
hi luka
139:43
yo sayori
139:45
looks like you're in a good mood today
139:49
i'm just still not used to you being the
139:52
club that's all
139:53
[Music]
139:56
i see
139:58
that's a pretty simple thing to get you
139:59
in a good mood
140:01
but i guess it's always simple things
140:02
with you anyway
140:05
speaking of which
140:07
i'm kinda hungry
140:09
will you come with me to buy a snack
140:12
no thanks
140:16
not like you at all
140:17
i have my reasons
140:20
why don't we take a look at your purse
140:21
so you worry
140:23
ah
140:24
my
140:25
by that all of a sudden
140:27
no reason really
140:29
i just wanted to look at it
140:33
sayori nervously retrieves her coin
140:35
purse
140:36
she fumbles with a latch and gets it
140:38
open
140:40
she then she turns it upside down and
140:42
lets it lets its content spill onto the
140:45
desk
140:47
only
140:48
only two small coins fall out wow
140:50
nice sayori nice
140:53
you're trying to find a leecher for me
140:58
[Music]
141:01
i knew it
141:03
i can see right through you sayori
141:11
boss is so cute when you make yuri jump
141:15
thank you for the blessing thank you for
141:17
the three dollars
141:21
thank you
141:28
it's simple
141:30
if you had enough money in the first
141:31
place you would have bought a snack
141:32
before coming to the club room
141:34
so either you're not hungry and wanted
141:37
wanted an excuse to take
141:39
a walk are you planning to conveniently
141:43
plan to conveniently forget that you
141:44
spent all your money so that i would
141:46
lend you some
141:47
but there's one more thing
141:49
you're always hungry
141:51
and so that only leaves one option
141:56
i give up
141:58
don't make me feel guilty
142:00
if you feel guilty that means you
142:01
deserve to feel guilty
142:06
yuri suddenly giggles
142:08
huh
142:11
i didn't notice that she was listening
142:13
in
142:14
her face is in her book as always
142:18
i wasn't listening or anything
142:20
it was just something in my book
142:23
yuri
142:25
oh look at it let me borrow some money
142:28
that's
142:29
don't get me involved like that sayori
142:32
besides
142:34
you should only buy what you can afford
142:36
responsibly afford
142:39
and frankly after pulling a miss miss
142:41
chivas mischievous mischievous
142:47
wait never mind your voice acting sick
142:49
thank you thanks thanks
142:53
it's a little sound like that your
142:54
suffering is fair enough retribution
142:58
then i just
143:00
i didn't mean it like that
143:03
i got too absorbed in my book
143:09
i really like when you i really like
143:10
when you speak your mind yuri it doesn't
143:12
happen much but it's a fun side of you
143:15
that's
143:16
there's no way you could think that
143:19
you were right though
143:20
i did something bad and
143:22
now i have to accept the revolution
143:25
retribution
143:26
not
143:27
still coming from you so yuri
143:30
i guess there's a little devil inside
143:31
all of us isn't there
143:34
don't let her fool you
143:36
so he already knows exactly what she's
143:37
doing
143:38
after all she told you guys she was
143:40
bringing me to the club before she even
143:41
told me
143:43
but but
143:45
you weren't enough calm if it weren't
143:46
for the cupcakes
143:47
so i had to check natsuki into making
143:49
them
143:50
come on
143:51
give me more credit than that so you
143:53
worry
144:00
out of nowhere something smacks a yori
144:02
in the face and tumbles onto the desk
144:05
ah
144:06
what the
144:07
[ __ ]
144:11
yeah
144:12
oh what was
144:14
ah
144:16
a cookie
144:17
sure enough it's a giant cookie wrapped
144:19
in plastic
144:20
sayori grant glances around
144:23
is this a miracle
144:25
it's because i paid my restitution
144:28
retribution
144:30
actually
144:31
that one almost works
144:32
[Laughter]
144:36
i was just gonna give it to you
144:39
but then i heard you blab about the
144:41
cupcakes
144:43
it was totally worth seeing your
144:44
reaction though
144:48
natsuki
144:49
that's so nice of you
144:51
i'm so happy
144:54
so yori hugs the cookie
144:56
jeez
144:57
just eat it
145:00
sayori rapidly tears open the wrap and
145:03
take some big bites
145:07
wait chat i need to put something in my
145:08
mouth
145:12
yes there we go
145:17
sayori suddenly clasps her heads over
145:19
her mouth
145:21
it bit my tongue
145:26
you just you're going through a lot or
145:28

145:30
natsuki takes a bite of our own cookie
145:33

145:54

sayori gets out of her seat and goes
145:57
behind natsuki then wraps her arms
145:59
around her
146:00
ah jeez
146:04
cookie still in hand natsuki reaches up
146:06

152:39
escapade
152:43
i'm sure natsuki will end up complaining
152:45
to her anyway
152:46
it looks like everyone has already
152:48
settled down
152:49
so yuri somehow already finished
152:52
finished her entire cookie
152:55
yuri is back to her book and natsuki
152:58
disappeared into the closet
153:03

153:22
a different book from the one we've been
153:24
reading together
153:27
sorry i didn't mean to interrupt
153:30

153:58
[Music]
153:59
not to mention
154:00
for yourself as well
154:03
yuri stands up and makes her way to the
154:06
closet
154:07
i follow and watch as she retrieves her
154:10
small water picture in a shelf the kind
154:13
with a filter inside
154:15
can you hold this for a second
154:17

154:19
yuri
154:20
here he hands me the water pitcher and
154:21
also fetches an electric kettle
154:24
i'm going to plug this in and
154:28

154:28
on orcas focus
154:31
i'm going to plug this in at the
154:33
teacher's desk and then we'll go get
154:36
some water
154:37
she walks past me and sets the kettle
154:39
down on the teacher's desk
154:42
i simply watch her movements
154:45
to my surprise the way she moves really
154:47
contrasts her contrasts her speaking
154:50
mannerisms
154:51
especially because of her long legs yuri
154:54
appears elegant and methodical
154:56
uh okay um
154:58

155:00
wait thanks i'll be right back

155:27
the water picture
155:27
[Music]
155:30
okay
155:31

155:39
monika
155:40
please mind your own business for once
155:43
or do you want or do you want to tell me
155:45
there's something wrong with helping
155:47

155:52
[Music]
155:53
my mouth gapes
155:56
[Music]
155:59
i
156:01
suppose there's nothing wrong with that
156:06
let's now let's go luca
156:08

156:09
yuri quickly exits the room and i follow
156:12
her
156:15
oh god what the heck is going on
156:22
what the
156:26
um
156:30
once in a hallway she suddenly puts her
156:32
forehead against the wall
156:36
i spark without thinking
156:39
how could i say something like that
156:41
yuri
156:42
i just
156:44
something about the way she said that
156:47
it made me feel so
156:49
irritated
156:50
what's wrong with me
156:53
no yuri
156:55
i think you did the right thing
156:58
i wasn't expecting it but
157:01
it's also not right for monica's judge
157:03
people like that
157:06
luca
157:08
[Music]
157:12
will come
157:14
even when i do something bad
157:16
you're being nice to me
157:19
because
157:20
[Music]
157:23
nothing that you do
157:25
is as bad as you make it seem in your
157:28
head
157:29
nobody's perfect
157:32
we have emotions and we can't always
157:35
hide them away
157:36
but you always amplify things in your
157:38
head
157:39
your mind turns a light rain shower into
157:42
a
157:44
hurricane no
157:47
wouldn't you hate me for something as
157:49
terrible as that
157:51

157:53
i can't hate somebody someone for having
157:55
it
157:56
i can't hate someone for having emotions
157:59
what kind of friend would do that
158:03

161:48
tea for others
161:50
even if i'm not an expert on tea or
161:51
anything
161:52
uh-huh
161:54
in that case
161:55
you'll only be even more impressed ah
161:58
perhaps i will
162:00
yuri fetches the teapot and begins
162:02
measuring the teal leaves
162:05
to my surprise she even starts humming
162:07
some
162:08
little to herself cute
162:11
you must be in a good mood now
162:12

162:16
and you noticed
162:19
ah good job luka good job good job
162:22
i was doing a little bit think a little
162:24
bit of thinking and i decided that i
162:27
would try expressing myself a little
162:29
more
162:30
it turns out
162:31
it's not a very hot it's not very hard
162:33
for me to do
162:36
when it's around
162:38
when it's
162:39
when it's huge around anyway
162:42
[Music]
162:46
ah
162:47
that's great yuri
162:48
[Music]
162:53
need your take on this which is heavier
162:55
one kg of stones or one kg of feathers
162:59
the stone
163:02
oh i know they're both one kilogram
163:05
[Music]
163:08
who won kg
163:12
they both won kg
163:13
[Music]
163:19
i forgot
163:24
guys
163:24
i'm smart i told you
163:26
[Music]
163:34
just don't push yourself too much
163:35
[Music]
163:37
you're always worrying about me luca
163:39
it's very endearing
163:41
that's
163:43
yuri wasn't kidding but thank you for
163:44
the donation though thank you guys wow
163:47
thank you so much
163:50
i don't even know how
163:51
how i don't even know if i can keep up
163:53
with this
163:54
i watch yuri pour a cup of tea for each
163:56
of us
163:57
look uh
163:58
i have another request
164:00
do you mind if we sit on the floor today
164:04
[Music]
164:06
why is that
164:08
it's a little bit easier on my back
164:12
i can reeve my pack against the wall
164:13
rather than bending over at my desk
164:18
oh sorry i didn't realize
164:24
no worries
164:25
i just had back pain fairly regularly so
164:28
i do my best to manage it
164:33
ah
164:36
i i get i see
164:38
that's why
164:40
that's why
164:42
is that
164:44
so i wonder why that is
164:49
it's most likely because of my
164:53
my
164:54
your posture right
164:55
[Music]
164:56
always hunched over like that while
164:58
reading
164:59
yes
165:01
i have a terrible reading posture
165:04
so that's why we should sit on the floor
165:06
fair enough
165:07
[Music]
165:09
i'll go ahead and get my book
165:11
[Music]
165:13
i retrieved the book from my bag
165:15
oh i have some chocolate as well
165:18
it's a bag of small chocolates from
165:21
candies that i keep hidden kept hidden
165:23
from sayori's candy radar
165:25
i take it i take it since
165:27
it'll go well with the tea
165:29
yuri and i sit against the wall
165:31
decarbs at our sides
165:34
as if in sync we assume the same reading
165:37
position as last time each holding one
165:40
half of the book
165:42
i can relate
165:44
what to the back problems
165:46
i don't have back problems guys
165:49
my god
165:51
our bodies are even closer
165:56
i
165:57
can't see too well
166:04
yuri slides closer until her shoulders
166:06
are touching
166:10
it's the same exact situation
166:15
[Music]
166:20
[Laughter]
166:22
[Music]
166:27
how am i supposed to focus on reading
166:28
like this
166:31
yuri was also kind always kind of cute
166:33
but
166:35
when she's being less apprehensive it's
166:38
almost more than i can handle
166:41
you're a teacup
166:43
yuri hands me my teacup
166:45
holding it
166:46
holding it with my hand that's not
166:48
holding the book i end up in a position
166:50
that makes it harder to focus
166:55
thanks for the entertaining stream and
166:56
story time sounds like you're
166:58
awkward
167:00
nobody looks
167:01
adorable
167:03
and definitely ah that's that's
167:05
embarrassing thank you rodrigo for the
167:08
five dollars thank you so much that's
167:09
embarrassing it's embarrassing to say
167:16
sorry guys
167:18
i probably didn't make sense though
167:24
okay
167:24
[Music]
167:27
meanwhile yuri hasn't noticed a single
167:28
thing
167:29
she wears her intense reading expression
167:32
and i can only presume the world around
167:34
her has faded away
167:35
i use all my willpower to focus on
167:38
reading
167:41
after a few minutes i finally managed to
167:43
relax
167:44
i put the teacup between my legs and
167:46
fumble with a chocolate wrapper
167:50
sorry
167:51
i briefly let go of the book
167:54
finish opening the wrapper
167:56
you can have as much as you want
167:59
ah that's
168:01
that's okay
168:02
i won't take any
168:05
are you sure
168:06
well
168:07
if i touch it then
168:09
you might get smudges on the pages
168:12
ah you're right
168:14
i didn't even think about that
168:17
my bad
168:18
no i need to i need to apologize
168:21
i'll hold the book okay
168:23
are you sure
168:25
of course
168:27
[Music]
168:37
chad
168:38
[Music]
168:40
i mean you haven't heard of oolong tea
168:42
but have you heard of bofa
168:44
[Music]
168:45
[Laughter]
168:47
thank you
168:49
nope i have never heard of bofa
168:56
[Music]
169:03
guys no
169:04
[Music]
169:07
yuri
169:09
opens the book with both hands
169:12
she holds it so that i don't have any
169:15
harder of a time reading from it
169:17
[Music]
169:18
but as a result
169:20
her left arm is practically resting on
169:23
top of my leg
169:25
[Music]
169:34
well
169:35
in that case
169:37
yuri is already totally focused on
169:39
reading again
169:41
i take a chocolate candy and pop it into
169:43
my mouth
169:45
then i take another chocolate
169:48
and i hold it up to yuri
169:50
she doesn't even look away from the book
169:52
[Music]
169:53
simply parked her lips
169:56
as if the situation was completely
169:58
natural
170:00
but that means i can't stop here
170:04
i have
170:05
hansibly place the chocolate in her
170:06
mouth
170:08
just like that yuri closes her lips over
170:10
it
170:12
huh
170:15
yuri's expression suddenly breaks
170:18
dead
170:20
did i just
170:23
yuri looks at me like she needs to
170:24
confirm what has happened
170:27
um
170:29
luca
170:31
[Music]
170:32
sorry
170:34
i guess i shouldn't have done that
170:36
oh that's
170:37
oh
170:39
you were just helping
170:42
that's something that
170:43
[Music]
170:46
friends
170:47
do
170:48
[Music]
171:01
[Laughter]
171:09
[Music]
171:16
right i mean
171:21
not really in this kind of context but
171:24
yeah
171:25
that's all it was
171:27
yeah
171:28
and
171:30
you don't need to stop or anything
171:32
i see
171:34
the situation has gotten
171:36
gotten really tense
171:37
yuri trying to try to return the book
171:40
but i can tell just by
171:42
[Music]
171:43
just by her expression that she can't
171:45
even focus
171:47
luke is owned
171:50
my heart is pounding
171:51
i nervously take another chocolate
171:53
between my fingers
171:54
but this time
171:56
eerie's eyes
171:58
meet
171:59
mine
172:02
[Music]
172:06
how did it even come to this
172:08
yuri doesn't have hurt her gaze
172:10
i noticed her chest rising and falling
172:12
into rhythm
172:16
i raise my arm
172:22
like before
172:26
yuri hot her lips
172:30
but it's different this time
172:33
i take the chocolate and place it in her
172:35
mouth
172:37
i feel her
172:40
hot breath on my fingers
172:42
god damn
172:45
okay everyone
172:46
oh
172:50
yuri jolt's back
172:54
it's time to share our poems
172:57
luka can you help yuri put away the tea
172:59
stuff right
173:02
yeah
173:03
of course
173:04
okay thanks
173:06
spells are probably broken
173:08
no why monica why why why
173:13
why
173:15
well
173:17
[Music]
173:19
i'll take care of the cubs
173:21
yeah
173:22
yuri picks up the teacups on the floor
173:25
i pick up the bags of chocolates in the
173:27
end we hastily clean up that so much as
173:30
a word between us
173:31
i get the feeling that this is something
173:33
neither of us will have the courage to
173:34
bring up
173:38
should i show my poem to first
173:41
latsky
173:43
ouch
173:46
i like your last one better
173:48
huh really
173:50
well i can tell you a little more
173:52
tearing with this one
173:53
but you're not really good enough for
173:55
that yet it felt flat
173:59
that may be true but
174:01
i just wanted to try something different
174:03
i'm still figuring figuring this all out
174:08
i mean i always like poems that aren't
174:10
too too hard
174:12
i'm trying too hard
174:14
i hate when people try to sound fancy
174:17
or add more meaning just by using
174:19
annoying complicated language
174:22
just make it simple and cute
174:24
did a point
174:26
eerie's head over heels for all this
174:28
cryptic nonsense
174:30
but i see right through that [ __ ]
174:40
boss your cursor
174:43
what
174:48
[Music]
174:53
what do you mean
174:57
[Music]
175:00
making your reader look so hard for all
175:02
this deep meaning is just an excuse to
175:05
have no meaning at all
175:08
i guess that's one way to look at it
175:10
well
175:11
everyone has their own opinions
175:13
but my opinion is that best opinion and
175:16
i'm sure you figured that out already
175:19
uh
175:20
anyway here's my poem maybe you'll learn
175:23
something
175:29
amy likes spiders
175:31
you know what i heard about amy
175:34
amy likes spiders
175:36
icky wrigley
175:38
hairy ugly spiders that's why i'm not
175:41
friends with her
175:43
amy has a cute singing voice and i heard
175:46
her singing
175:47
my favorite love song
175:49
every time she sang the chorus my heart
175:51
would pound through the rhythm of the
175:54
words but she likes spiders that's why
175:57
i'm not friends with her
175:59
one time i hurt my leg real bad
176:02
amy helped me up and took me to the
176:04
nurse i tried not to let her touch me
176:06
she likes spiders so her hands are
176:08
probably gross
176:09
that's why i'm not friends with her
176:12
amy has a lot of friends i always see
176:14
her talking to a lot of people she
176:16
probably talks about spiders what if her
176:18
friends start to like spiders too
176:21
that's why i'm not friends with her
176:23
it doesn't matter if she has other
176:25
hobbies it doesn't matter if she has
176:28
if she keeps it private it doesn't
176:29
matter if she keeps if she doesn't hurt
176:31
anyone
176:32
it's gross she's gross the world is
176:34
better off without spider lovers
176:37
and i'm gonna tell everyone any spider
176:40
lovers here
176:44
any spider lovers cause i hate spiders
176:48
[Music]
176:53
no
176:56
you guys do what what
177:00
not bad right
177:02
it's quite a bit longer than yesterday's
177:05
yesterday was way too short i was just
177:08
one warming up
177:10
i hope you didn't think that was the
177:11
best i could do
177:13
no of course not
177:15
anyways the message is pretty
177:16
straightforward in this poem
177:19
yeah i have to explain it
177:21
sometimes you can just even explain
177:23
complicated issues it's much
177:25
simpler i know
177:27
thank you natsuki
177:30
dude
177:31
when i used to do english class in high
177:34
school
177:36
it's like
177:37
why
177:38
do we have
177:40
why do we have to try
177:42
and and
177:45
and just figure out what a page means
177:50
oh luca was walking under the
177:53
the rain
177:54
5 p.m at night
177:57
while two cars walk across the street
178:04
now what does that paragraph mean
178:06
you know what i mean
178:08
[Music]
178:17
[Music]
178:22
now explain what is going on
178:25
in this situation
178:26
[Music]
178:28
give me the meaning
178:30
of why it's 5 a.m and it's raining and
178:34
there's
178:35
cars on the road
178:46
walk i didn't say that
178:49
i didn't say that what i mean
178:52
[Music]
178:58
no i didn't
179:03
it means you're drunk
179:06
okay
179:07
and it helps people realize how stupid
179:09
you're being i didn't say that guys i
179:11
said cause
179:12
like on the road
179:19
[Music]
179:25
it's on a gaslight chat what
179:31
and it helps people realize how stupid
179:34
they're being
179:35
like anyone would agree that such a
179:37
subject of this poem is an ignorant
179:39
chick
179:41
do you know people like that
179:43
of course
179:44
it's about how everyone thinks my
179:46
that doesn't matter
179:48
it can be about anything
179:50
i wrote it to be easy to relate to
179:54
right clip it then guys and show me off
179:56
to the stream yes
179:58
everyone has some kind of weird hobby or
180:00
guilty pleasure
180:01
something that you're afraid of people
180:03
find out they make fun of you or think
180:05
less of you
180:06
but that just makes people stupid
180:09
cares what makes what someone likes as
180:11
long as they're not hurting anyone and
180:13
it makes them happy
180:14
i think people really need to learn to
180:16
respect others for liking weird things
180:19
well you're definitely right
180:21
[Music]
180:22
at least i can relate to that
180:24
i'm sure a lot of people can too
180:27
it's what i do best after all
180:29
i don't like writing unless there's a
180:31
good message to take away from it
180:33
like conveying emotions is important
180:36
i want to make people think
180:38
not just feel
180:40
remember that
180:42
i'm going to write a good one for
180:43
tomorrow so look forward to it
180:46
[Music]
180:47
natsuki
180:49
sayori
180:53
oh
180:54
i like this one luka
180:56
it has some nice feelings in it
180:58
i'm glad
181:00
does that mean it's better than
181:01
yesterday's
181:02
let me think
181:04
i don't know what what the [ __ ]
181:07
i guess i like them both
181:11
[Music]
181:17
that's not very helpful you know well
181:20
i'm not very good at figuring out poems
181:22
if our if poems are good or not
181:25
but that's why i just go by
181:28
that's why i just go by my heart oh my
181:31
god
181:33
it makes me feel things then it must be
181:35
a good poem
181:37
i'm not exactly sure how it works
181:40
and again i guess conveying feelings is
181:42
a pretty important part of this whole
181:43
thing
181:45
yeah maybe
181:47
honestly i didn't even know what kind of
181:49
riding you like in the first place
181:51
no
181:52
me neither
181:54
ah
181:55
why don't you at least try giving it
181:56
some thought
181:57
uh you want to write something for me
182:00
that's so sweet
182:02
yeah right
182:04
you're always thinking about other
182:05
people
182:06
you need to think about yourself once in
182:07
a while
182:08
if you don't you might end up getting
182:10
hurt at some point
182:12
ah
182:13
well
182:14
i don't really know what you mean but
182:15
i'll try to keep it in mind oh no it's a
182:18
yori not natsuki
182:20
i don't really know what you mean but
182:21
i'll try to keep it in mind
182:24
well whatever
182:26
anyway let's see
182:32
i guess i like happy poems
182:34
wait
182:35
sometimes i like sad poems too
182:38
sometimes a little bit of both
182:40
there's a word for that right
182:43
ah what's the word i was thinking
182:44
looking for
182:46
bittersweet
182:47
nah
182:49
i like the things that are happy and
182:50
they're sad
182:52
happy and sad
182:53
i can't see you liking something sad
182:55
sayori well
182:57
i like happy the most
183:00
but sometimes we have a little rain
183:01
cloud in your head
183:03
a sad poem can help you give the rain
183:05
cloud a little hug
183:06
and make you a nice happy rainbow
183:09
so yori that's unexpectedly
183:12
poetic
183:13
[Music]
183:15
it is
183:16
maybe i'm getting better it's
183:19
uh i expressed my feelings after all
183:22
thanks luca
183:24
i should go write that down then
183:26
you can read my bomb now okay he's so
183:28
cute guys i actually think sayori is
183:30
cute
183:31
[Music]
183:35
bottles i pop off my scalp
183:38
like the lid of a cookie what
183:47
it's the secret place where i keep all
183:48
my dreams little balls of sunshine all
183:51
rubbing together like a bundle of
183:52
kittens kittens
183:55
i reach inside my thumb and forefinger
183:57
and pluck one out
183:59
but it's warm and tingly
184:01
but there's no time to waste i put it in
184:03
a bottle to keep it safe
184:05
i put the bottle on the shelf and all
184:08
the other bottles
184:09
happy thoughts happy thoughts happy
184:11
thoughts in bottles all in a row
184:14
my collection makes me lots of friends
184:18
each bottle has starlight to make amends
184:21
sometimes my friend feels a certain way
184:24
down comes a bottle to save the day
184:27
night after night more dreams friend
184:30
after friend more bottles
184:32
deeper and deeper my fingers go
184:33
exploring a dark cave discovering the
184:35
secrets hiding in the nukes and crannies
184:38
digging and digging scraping and
184:40
scraping i blurbed dust off my bottle
184:44
it's so long
184:47
[Music]
184:50
it doesn't feel like time elapsed my
184:52
empty shelf could use some more
184:55
my friends look through the fox front
184:57
door
184:58
finally all done i open up and
185:01
income my friends
185:05
uh if they come in in such a hurry do
185:08
they want my bottles that much
185:09
i frantically pull them from the shelf
185:12
one after the other the other
185:16
holding them out to each and every
185:18
friend
185:19
each and every bottle but every time i
185:21
let one go it shatters against the tile
185:23
between my feet
185:25
happy thoughts happy thoughts happy
185:26
thoughts and shards all over the floor
185:29
they were supposed to be for my friends
185:31
and my friends who aren't smiling
185:34
they're all shouting pleading something
185:37
but all i hear is echo
185:40
echo
185:41
echo
185:42
echo echo
185:44
inside my head
185:46
[Music]
185:52
holy crap
185:53
sayori did you really write this
185:57
of course i did did i tell you yesterday
185:59
i was gonna write the best poem ever
186:01
yeah but
186:03
i mean i didn't expect something like
186:04
this coming from you
186:07
monica taught me a lot
186:09
and i've been really in touch with my
186:10
feelings recently i see that
186:14
oh it's almost kind of creepy
186:16
creepy
186:17
well not exactly maybe because i'm so
186:19
used to you being so cheerful
186:22
well well
186:23
never mind
186:25
i'm thinking too hard about it the point
186:27
is it came out good so you should be
186:29
proud of it
186:30
oh thanks
186:31
i feel i feel like
186:34
i feel like i was meant to express
186:35
myself this way
186:37
it even helps me understand my own
186:39
feelings a little better
186:41
fighting is like magic
186:43
[Music]
186:44
you've gotten pretty passionate about
186:46
this huh
186:47
i hope you keep it up
186:49
yeah
186:50
writing's the best
186:52
i'm gonna keep writing until i die
186:56
get ahead of yourself
186:57
so yori always had a habit of getting
186:59
obsessed with something before dropping
187:00
him no more than a week later
187:02
i wonder if this is one of those times
187:05
but seeing the passion in her eyes makes
187:07
it hard for me to be so pessimistic
187:10
[Music]
187:15
okay
187:16
two more guys
187:19
oh what it's only been three hours it
187:21
feels like it's been
187:22
seven
187:24
my god
187:27
i'm going way too
187:34
let's see what you've got written for
187:35
today
187:37
here he stares at the po
187:40
with a surprise expression on her face
187:42
do you like it
187:44
look huh
187:46
this one might even be better than
187:48
yesterday's
187:49
how did you eat how did you even pick up
187:51
on it so quickly
187:54
just yesterday i was telling you the
187:55
kind of text techniques worth practicing
187:58
maybe that's why
188:00
you did a good job explaining
188:02
i really wanted to give it more imagery
188:05
yuri visibly swallows
188:10
even her hands appear sweaty
188:15
i'm not used to this
188:16
use the one
188:18
i don't know
188:19
it's fine take your time
188:23
i think yuri likes to think before she
188:25
speaks so i often offer that patience
188:27
with her
188:28
yeah
188:30
just being appreciated like this i guess
188:32
it probably sounds really stupid but
188:35
seeing someone motivated by my writing
188:38
it just makes me
188:39
really happy
188:41
are you saying that you've never shared
188:42
your writing before
188:47
really
188:48
i don't believe it
188:50
i really only write for myself
188:52
besides
188:53
people would just laugh at me
188:56
do you really think that
188:58
yuri again nods
189:00
ah
189:02
even your close friends
189:04
yuri doesn't respond to that
189:06
i wonder why
189:08
anyway
189:09
do you want to share the poem the poem
189:12
you wrote today
189:13
ah
189:14
i do if it's with you
189:20
[Music]
189:21
the raccoon
189:23
it happened in the dead of night while i
189:25
was slicing bread
189:27
for a guilty sack snack snack
189:33
my attention
189:35
was caught by the sky
189:37
scuttering of a raccoon outside my
189:40
window
189:41
that was i believe
189:42
the first time first time i noticed my
189:45
strange tendencies as a
189:49
as a
189:50
an ordinary human
189:53
guys these are long ones
189:58
i gave the raccoon a piece of bread my
190:00
subconscious well aware of the
190:01
consequences well aware that the raccoon
190:04
is fed
190:07
will always come back for more
190:11
the enticing beauty of cutting knife was
190:13
the symptom
190:14
the bread my hungry curiosity
190:17
the raccoon an urge
190:20
the moon increments it's pla it's
190:23
ah it's so
190:26
[Music]
190:37
the very same light that glistens in the
190:39
eyes of my raccoon friend i slice the
190:42
bread fresh and soft raccoon becomes
190:45
excited
190:47
[Music]
190:48
or perhaps i'm merely projecting my
190:51
emotions onto the newly satisfied animal
190:54
the raccoon has taken to following me
190:57
you could say that we've gotten quite
190:59
used to each other the raccoon becomes
191:01
hungry more and more frequently so my
191:03
bread is always handy
191:04
every time i brandish my cutting knife
191:06
the raccoon shows me it's excitement a
191:09
rush of blood classy have
191:11
love
191:13
pervian conditioning
191:15
i slice the bread and i feed myself
191:18
again
191:21
[Music]
191:22
um
191:23
[Music]
191:25
it was
191:26
more
191:27
daring with this one than yesterday
191:29
i can see that
191:31
it's a lot it's a lot more
191:34
metaphorical i don't know if it's my
191:36
phone but i just can't begin to bring my
191:39
imagination
191:40
oh
191:45
wow this is actually pretty tiring guys
191:47
i'm not gonna lie this is pretty tiring
191:50
wow
191:53
i thought i was gonna
191:54
be fine
191:57
[Music]
192:00
you wanna rest
192:04
considering there's like 10 more hours
192:05
of this apparently
192:08
[Music]
192:12
oh my god guys
192:17
i feel a little tired too to be honest
192:23
how far are we in how far how far are we
192:25
in
192:27
take a break
192:28
take a break because my
192:30
jaw is
192:32
fuming
192:38
not far at all
192:41
oh
192:49
[Music]
192:51
wow
192:55
holy sh
192:57
but we need to finish this
193:00
let's finish the day then take a break
193:02
okay
193:03
all right let's finish the day and then
193:05
take a break
193:08
let's finish today
193:09
right
193:12
that's right it's a bit closer to my
193:15
preferred writing style
193:17
using the poem as a canvas to express
193:19
vivid imagery and conveying emotions
193:22
through them
193:23
yeah if i take it at face value then i
193:25
can't even figure out what it's supposed
193:28
to mean
193:29
well
193:30
i think it's something that different
193:31
people can relate to in their own way
193:33
i wanted to express the way it feels for
193:35
me to indulge in
193:37
my more unusual hobbies
193:39
and those sort of things i'm usually
193:41
forced to keep to myself
193:43
so i sometimes enjoy writing about them
193:48
that's funny
193:50
did a natsuki also write something about
193:52
that
193:52
about something someone being ridiculed
193:54
for strange interests
193:58
she she did
194:00
yeah
194:02
she was talking about how it doesn't
194:03
matter
194:04
what you're into as long as you're not
194:06
hurting anyone
194:07
she she's
194:08
right uh i mean
194:11
does she really feel that way
194:14
yeah
194:15
sounds like you to have that in common
194:18
that's well that's inter that's
194:20
interesting
194:22
to me she seemed like the kind of person
194:23
who would make fun of my hobbies
194:25
but i suppose that's my fault for
194:27
judging right
194:29
please don't tell her i said that
194:32
don't worry
194:33
i have no reason to
194:36
okay
194:37
well thank you for sharing it with me
194:39
after all if i hadn't learned to embrace
194:41
my own weirdness i probably wouldn't
194:43
hate myself
194:45
i might be ranting a little bit now
194:48
but i'm glad that you're such a good
194:50
listener we got a lot of things
194:54
writing
194:55
listening
194:57
there really aren't many people like you
194:59
luca oh thank you yuri
195:02
that's exaggerating in a little bit
195:05
it's just how i feel
195:07
i never thought i would feel so
195:09
comfortable sharing my writing
195:11
but now
195:12
i almost feel like i look forward to it
195:15
it's just a really nice feeling
195:18
and you just think for that
195:20
it's
195:21
it's nothing really
195:25
yuri smiles sincerely at me
195:32
for just a moment the timing seems to
195:35
disappear
195:39
last one
195:45
hi again luca sorry
195:49
how's the ryan going
195:51
all right i guess
195:52
i'll take that
195:54
as long as i'm going bad
195:56
i'm happy that you're applying yourself
195:59
maybe soon you'll come up with a
196:00
masterpiece
196:02
i wouldn't count on that
196:04
you never know
196:10
want to share what you wrote for today
196:12
sure here you go
196:14
i give my opponents to monica
196:17
all right
196:18
this one's good
196:20
i feel like you're not only getting more
196:21
comfortable with your style
196:23
but the imagery is better than the last
196:25
one i read
196:27
just wondering what you've been finding
196:29
inspiration in
196:30
yuri's writing style
196:33
hmm
196:34
i guess sir
196:35
you can't deny that she's talented
196:38
yeah totally
196:40
i think her poems are the most
196:42
romantic that's the best way to describe
196:45
it
196:46
she's like a totally different person
196:48
when she picks up a pen
196:50
i notice that too
196:51
or when she's talking about literature
196:53
it's like a light turns inside
196:56
turns on inside her
196:59
sadly it's hard to get much personal
197:01
conversation out of her
197:02
but trust me i've tried
197:05
who knows
197:07
what goes in that head of hers
197:09
i hope you don't mean that in a bad way
197:14
of course not of course not
197:17
i just meant that i
197:19
like i wish she didn't keep much to
197:21
herself
197:23
but still defending her like that you
197:25
must be pretty into her
197:28
huh
197:29
you're completely misunderstood
197:33
calm down silly
197:35
silly you
197:37
baca
197:38
i'm kidding
197:41
besides i'm pretty sure she's already
197:43
got a boyfriend
197:45
wait really
197:46
[Music]
197:48
no
197:53
yeah affectionate oh
197:56
whoa
197:57
okay monica
198:00
money monica kind of whispers that last
198:02
part to me
198:04
it's just a hunch but
198:06
oh well there's not really anything
198:08
wrong with that
198:10
oh well
198:11
i know
198:13
i was just saying
198:14
but anyway
198:16
you want to read my poem now
198:18
i i like the way this one turned out so
198:22
i hope you do too
198:25
alright let's take a look
198:27
please don't be long please don't be
198:29
long
198:31
save me
198:32
the coolest
198:34
they won't stop
198:36
bright beautiful colors
198:38
flashing expanding piercing
198:41
red green blue and endless cacophony
198:44
of meaningless noise
198:47
and noise it won't stop
198:49
violent
198:50
creating waveforms
198:52
squeaking screeching piercing sign
198:56
cosine tangent
198:58
like playing a chalkboard on a turntable
199:01
like playing a vinno on a pizza crust
199:05
an endless
199:06
poem
199:07
of meaningless
199:10
lured me
199:14
[Music]
199:19
it's even more abstract than your last
199:20
one huh
199:23
i guess it's just the way i write
199:26
i'm sorry if you don't like it
199:28
i never said that
199:30
it's just that this is the kind of thing
199:32
i've never really seen before i guess
199:34
i kind of like playing with
199:37
i
199:39
put my own space on the paper
199:42
choosing where and how to space your
199:44
words can totally change the mood of the
199:46
poem
199:48
it's almost like magic
199:50
the way i wrote the lines and
199:52
really short
199:54
makes it feel like they're trying to
199:55
speak over the noise
199:58
i
199:58
see
200:00
it's still hard for me to tell what it's
200:02
about though
200:05
sometimes asking about what a poem is
200:07
isn't the right question
200:09
a poem can be abstract as a physical
200:12
expression of a feeling or a
200:14
conversation with a reader
200:16
[Music]
200:18
so putting it away not every poem is
200:20
about something
200:23
anyway
200:24
here's monica's writing tip of the day
200:27
sometimes you'll find yourself facing a
200:29
difficult decision
200:31
when that happens don't forget to save
200:33
your gay
200:38
what
200:40
never know what might change your mind
200:44
what
200:49
[Music]
200:51
okay i saved
200:53
or when something unexpected may happen
200:57
wait is this tip even about writing
201:00
what am i even talking about
201:02
what
201:05
that's my advice for today
201:08
what do you mean advise
201:12
thanks for listening
201:15
okay everyone
201:17
we're all done reading in each each
201:19
other's poems right
201:22
i have some something extra planned
201:24
today so if everyone could come sit at
201:26
the front of room
201:28
is this about the festival
201:31
oh well sort of
201:34
oh
201:35
do we really have to do the
201:39
i can feel it i can feel the strain
201:42
[Music]
201:44
god damn yanovsky
201:46
god damn you
201:52
i'll i'll keep it relaxed okay
201:55
do we really have to do something for
201:56
the festival
201:58
it's not like we can put together
201:59
anything good in just a few days
202:04
well
202:05
this end up we'll just end up
202:06
embarrassing ourselves instead of making
202:08
any new members
202:10
that's a concern of mine as well
202:12
i don't really do well in the last
202:14
minute preparations
202:16
don't worry so much
202:18
we gotta keep that simple okay
202:21
wait where's sayori
202:26
we won't need much of a few decorations
202:28
anyway
202:30
sayori has been working on posters
202:33
and i've designed some pamphlets we can
202:35
give out during the event
202:37
okay that's great and all but that
202:39
doesn't tell us what we're actually
202:41
going to be doing for the event
202:43
[Music]
202:44
ah sorry
202:46
i thought you heard about her already
202:48
we're going to be performing
202:50
performing
202:53
um monika
202:55
yeah
202:56
we're going to be having a poverty
202:57
poetry performance
203:00
each of us are going
203:02
i want to choose a poem to recite during
203:04
the event
203:05
but the cool part is we're also going to
203:08
let anyone
203:09
we're also going to let anyone else come
203:11
up with
203:16
sorry what wha i for some reason i can't
203:18
read this
203:19
we're also going to let anyone else come
203:21
up with their recite poems too
203:24
sayari sayori's
203:27
putting it on the
203:30
guys i just had a wow my brain
203:34
my brain just
203:36
went blank
203:44
my brain just went blank i don't know
203:46
why
203:50
uh
203:52
she's back
203:54
sayori who's been coloring a poster
203:56
holds it up for us to see
203:59
are you kidding me monica
204:02
come in
204:03
already start putting those posters up
204:05
did you
204:07
uh well
204:08
i did
204:10
do you really think it's that bad about
204:11
idea
204:13
oh no
204:14
it's not a bad idea
204:16
but i didn't sign up for this you know
204:18
i didn't sign up for this
204:21
it's like it's xla it's ike's line
204:26
[Music]
204:31
it's
204:40
there's no way i'm going to be
204:42
performing in front of a group of people
204:44
like that
204:46
i i agree with natsuki
204:48
i could never
204:49
in my life do something like that
204:52
in fact match
204:54
[Music]
204:55
imagining that yuri shakes her head in
204:57
fear
204:59
nice
205:01
no sayori
205:02
i understand where they're coming from
205:05
remember that natsuki and yuri have
205:06
never shared their poems with anyone
205:08
until just a couple of days ago
205:10
it's a lot to ask for them to recite
205:12
their poems out loud to a whole room
205:14
full of people
205:16
i guess i kind of overlooked that
205:19
so i'm sorry
205:23
but
205:25
i still think we should give it our best
205:28
we're the only ones that responsible for
205:30
the fate of this club
205:32
if we start the event each put on a good
205:35
of a performance
205:37
and it will inspire others to do the
205:39
same
205:41
and the more people who perform the
205:43
better we'll be able to show everyone
205:45
what literature is all about
205:48
yeah
205:49
it's about expressing your feelings
205:52
being intimate with yourself
205:54
finding new horizons
205:56
and having fun
205:58
that's right
205:59
and it's those reasons that we're all in
206:01
this club today
206:03
don't you want to share that with others
206:06
to inspire them to find the same feeling
206:08
that brought you here in the first place
206:10
i know you do
206:12
i know we all do
206:13
and if it all takes
206:15
standing in front of a room for two
206:17
minutes in reciting a poem
206:19
and i know you can do it
206:24
natsuki and yuri remains silent
206:26
so yuri looks
206:28
worried
206:29
i guess that leaves me no choice i agree
206:33
i don't think it's too much to ask
206:36
i think that sayori and monica
206:39
have been trying really hard to get new
206:42
members
206:43
the least we can do is help them out a
206:44
little bit well maybe but
206:48
looks like natsuki doesn't have any
206:50
arguments left
206:52
okay fine
206:54
i guess i'll just have to get it over
206:55
with
206:57
all right
206:58
bill thanks natsuki
207:01
what about you yuri
207:05
yuri dejectedly glances around everyone
207:08
else's expectant face
207:12
i guess i don't really have a choice
207:16
that's awesome
207:19
you're the best yuri
207:21
this club is seriously going to be the
207:24
death of me
207:26
oh gosh
207:27
you'll be fine yuri
207:29
but anyway
207:30
let's move on to the main event
207:32
i want each of you to choose a poem of
207:34
yours we're going to practice reciting
207:36
them in front of each other
207:38
no way
207:41
monica this is too sudden
207:44
oh
207:45
if you can't recite your poem in front
207:46
of the club how do you expect to do it
207:48
in front of strangers
207:50
oh no
207:51
don't worry
207:52
i'll start off to help everyone feel a
207:54
little more comfortable
207:58
can i go next
208:00
of course
208:01
now let's see
208:03
monica flips through her notebook to the
208:05
specific permit she has in mind for
208:07
herself
208:09
she stands behind the perineum
208:12
the title of this poem is with the way
208:14
the fly they fly
208:17
okay she recites the poem
208:20
confident voice nice
208:23
inflection is
208:26
pristine
208:30
she knows exactly how to apply immersion
208:32
behind each line she recites
208:34
bringing the words to life
208:39
i glance around me
208:40
everyone has their eyes on monica
208:43
sayori looks amazed yuri has an intense
208:45
expression on her face and i don't
208:47
understand
208:48
finally
208:50
monica finished the recitation
208:52
the four of us applaud
208:57
like that
208:59
monica
209:00
takes a breath and smiles
209:03
that that was so good monica
209:07
[Music]
209:09
thank you so much
209:10
i was just hoping to get a good sample
209:13
are you ready to go next iori
209:16
oh i'll go next
209:18
wow kyrie's fired up all of a sudden
209:24
yuri clutches a sheet of paper between
209:26
her hands and stands up
209:28
keeping her head down she walks
209:31
quickly over to the podium
209:35
this poem is called
209:37
yuri anxiously glances at each of us
209:41
you can do it so you're you're here yeah
209:43
you know yuri
209:45
it's called after image of a crimson eye
209:50
yuri's voice shakes as she starts to
209:52
read the poem just a moment ago she
209:55
practically refused to do this
209:57
why why is she suddenly putting in so
209:59
much effort
210:03
as yuri gets past the first couple of
210:05
lines her voice changes
210:06
it's almost like what happens when yuri
210:08
gets absorbed into her books
210:10
a quivering words transform the sharp
210:13
syllables of a fierce and confident
210:15
woman
210:17
the poem is full of twists and turns in
210:20
its structure that she enunciates with
210:23
perfect timing
210:26
this must be a rare glimpse into the
210:27
whirling fire yuri keeps concealed
210:30
inside her head
210:32
suddenly she's finished everyone's
210:34
stunned
210:35
yuri snaps back to reality
210:38
and glances around her
210:40
as if she's bewildered even herself
210:46
i
210:47
it's
210:48
up to me to say the situation
210:51
i'm the first to start uploading
210:55
yuri
210:57
everyone joins me afterwards
210:59
and get and we give yuri the recognition
211:02
she deserves
211:05
it's not that it's not that we didn't
211:06
want to afford her we were just so
211:08
caught off guard
211:10
we would we must have forgotten
211:12
as we applaud yuri holds the poem to her
211:15
chest and rushes back to her seat
211:18
kiri that was really good
211:20
thanks for sharing
211:23
looks like yuri's down for the count
211:25
okay
211:27
i guess i guess i'm next
211:29
sayori helps out
211:31
my metter is the name
211:34
ah
211:37
sorry i can't go to what
211:45
it's a lot harder than i thought
211:47
how did you guys do it so easily
211:49
uh
211:50
try not to think of it like you're
211:52
reciting to other people
211:53
imagine you're resigning to yourself
211:55
like in front of a mirror
211:57
or
211:58
in your own head
212:00
it's your poem
212:03
so it'll come out the best
212:05
that way
212:08
i see i see
212:09
okay then
212:11
sayori begins her poem
212:13
somehow it feels like her soft voice was
212:15
made as a perfect match
212:19
the poem isn't aimlessly cheery like
212:21
sayuri is
212:22
it's serene and bittersweet
212:24
if i were to read this on paper i
212:26
probably would wouldn't think much of it
212:29
but hearing it coming from sayori's
212:31
voice almost gives it a whole new
212:33
different meaning
212:36
maybe this is what sayori meant when she
212:38
said she likes poems
212:41
it's like i get
212:43
to reach more deeply to someone i
212:45
thought i knew through and through
212:47
so you already finished this and we
212:48
applied nice
212:51
i did it
212:52
good job sayori
212:54
even look liked it
212:58
i guess that's a good sign
213:00
what does that even mean
213:03
[Music]
213:04
came out nicely sayori the atmosphere of
213:07
the palm fits you really nicely
213:10
but it might be that other poems
213:13
wouldn't work quite as well with that
213:14
kind of delivery
213:17
i don't really understand
213:19
in other words i've seen palms of yours
213:22
where that sort of gentle delivery
213:23
wouldn't work as well
213:25
they might need a little more force
213:27
behind them
213:28
depending on what you're trying to read
213:30
oh i know what you mean
213:34
that's well i've been practicing that
213:36
kind of thing
213:37
it's just embarrassing to do it in front
213:39
of everyone
213:42
then next time i'm going to make you
213:43
pick a poem that challenges you a little
213:45
more
213:46
i don't have much time before this
213:48
festival you know
213:49
okay
213:52
now who now is next
213:54
osu
213:57
don't make me go before luca
214:00
it's not like i can compare to you guys
214:02
anyway
214:04
might as well let look and lower
214:05
everyone's standards before i
214:08
a little before i have to do it
214:10
monsky
214:13
it's fine it's fine
214:14
[Music]
214:17
i might as well get it over with
214:20
it's not like i have much of a selection
214:22
of what to read anyway
214:25
i'll just have to go go with what i
214:26
wrote for today
214:28
i stand up and step in front of the
214:30
podium
214:32
everyone has their
214:34
eyes on me
214:35
making me
214:36
feel terribly
214:39
[Music]
214:40
awkward the staring at me guys
214:45
it's staring at me
214:47
i recite my poem
214:49
since i'm not exactly confident in my
214:51
own writing it's hard to put energy into
214:53
it despite that once i finish i receive
214:56
applause anyway
215:00
sorry i'm not really as good as everyone
215:02
else
215:04
don't worry about it too much
215:06
it's about less i think it's less about
215:08
your abilities and more about your lack
215:09
of confidence in your writing
215:12
i think that's something that'll improve
215:13
over time though
215:15
yeah maybe
215:16
all right then
215:17
i just leaves you natsuki
215:19
yeah yeah
215:21
i'm going
215:31
because you're presenting
215:39
anyway the poem is called jump
215:44
once she starts reciting the poem her
215:46
sour attitude disappears a little
215:49
while she's still a little mis uh
215:51
enthused
215:52
her poem has a rhythm and rhyme to it
215:55
it's nasty's trademark style and it
215:57
works surprisingly well when spoken out
215:59
loud the words feel like they bounce up
216:01
and down as if giving life to my poem
216:05
nanski finishes and everyone applauds
216:08
nice nice nice nice
216:10
she helps back to her seat
216:13
that wasn't so bad wasn't it
216:15
easy for you to sing
216:17
you better not make me do that again uh
216:20
well
216:22
do you at least feel prepared enough to
216:24
recite upon other people
216:28
i mean doing it in front of other people
216:31
will be way
216:32
easier i can put on whatever face i want
216:35
for the other people
216:37
but when it's just my friends
216:40
it's just embarrassing
216:44
that's a surprise natsuki
216:48
i think it would be the other way around
216:50
for me
216:52
well
216:53
well
216:54
that's just how it is so
216:56
well i guess in that case
216:59
we won't have to worry much about the
217:00
festival that said i want to thank
217:03
everyone for coming through
217:05
it might be hard but i hope that you all
217:06
have an idea of what it's like now
217:09
make sure you pick up home and get
217:11
enough practice before the festival okay
217:14
i'll be making pamphlets so let me know
217:16
ahead of time what you'll be reciting
217:19
geez

don't worry i just walked into
233:49
uh were you practicing the piano again
233:52
yeah
233:55
you must have a lot of determination
233:58
starting this club and now picking up a
234:00
piano
234:02
well maybe not determination
234:05
[Music]
234:06
but i guess
234:08
passion
234:09
remember the club wouldn't be here if it
234:11
wasn't all for you
234:14
and i'm super happy you're all willing
234:16
to help out help out for the festival
234:18
too
234:22
ah
234:23
i can't wait for the festival
234:28
let's make ourselves a little tinier
234:30
there we go
234:36
it's gonna be great
234:37
huh
234:39
weren't you complaining about it
234:40
yesterday natsuki
234:42
well yeah
234:44
it's not talking about our part of the
234:47
festival
234:48
but it's a whole day of school where we
234:50
get to play and eat all kinds of
234:52
delicious food
234:54
you sound a bit like sayori all of a
234:55
sudden
234:57
monica did they usually have sprite
234:59
squids
235:00
it's good
235:02
that's a pretty specific thing to look
235:03
forward to
235:05
oh come on
235:07
are you saying you don't like squid i
235:09
don't like squid i don't like squid i
235:11
think squid's kinda
235:14
icky
235:17
oh you of all people
235:22
i didn't say i don't like it
235:24
besides what do you mean you of all
235:27
people because
235:29
it's writing your name
235:31
monika
235:34
what
235:36
monika
235:38
what's that mean
235:42
not how you say my name at all
235:44
also that joke makes no sense in
235:46
translation
235:48
huh
235:50
never mind
235:51
let's just focus on our own event for
235:53
now okay
235:56
fine fine
235:58
your reactions aren't as fun as yuris or
236:00
sayori's anyway
236:02
excuse me
236:04
where is the yori anyway
236:06
oh there you are
236:08
sitting at a desk in the corner of the
236:09
room looking down at nothing i walk over
236:11
to her
236:14
no
236:14
i think she's actually like depressed
236:17
guys
236:23
i leave my hand in front of her face
236:27
ah
236:28
he's facing out again
236:33
sorry
236:34
don't mind me
236:36
you can go talk to everyone else huh
236:39
is everything all right
236:40
of course
236:42
um why wouldn't it be
236:45
just feels like you're a little off
236:48
sorry for shooting things
236:50
jeez worry too much about me
236:53
i'm fine see
236:58
sayori shows me a big smile
237:01
[Music]
237:05
don't let me distract you from having
237:06
fun with everyone
237:08
well alright
237:10
you say sir
237:11
i worriedly glance at sayori before
237:13
turning back with everyone else
237:17
the conversation was already dispersed
237:19
with everyone back at their usual
237:20
activities
237:21
maybe i should ask monica if she's
237:24
noticed anything about sayori lately
237:26
since they've been preparing for the
237:27
festival she must be spending a lot of
237:28
time together they must be
237:31
i typically approach monica who's
237:33
shuffling through some papers at her
237:34
desk
237:36
linka
237:38
what's up
237:39
hey this might sound a little strange
237:41
but
237:42
have you noticed anything with sayori
237:44
recently
237:45
anything anything up her
237:47
in more way than you mean
237:50
maybe i'm reading into it a little too
237:51
much but she seems a bit downcast today
237:54
oh you think so
237:57
i can't say i've noticed anything about
237:58
her
237:59
monica peers across the room at sayori
238:02
is idly dragging a rubber racer drown
238:06
up and down her desk
238:09
maybe something is on her mind
238:11
i'm surprised i'm not the only one
238:13
asking you
238:15
you certainly know her a lot more better
238:17
than i do
238:18
yeah but she's never really been like
238:20
this
238:21
she's always talked to me about the
238:23
things that bothered her
238:25
but this time when i asked her she was
238:27
really dismissive
238:28
sorry i know it's not your problem i
238:30
just wanted to ask if you knew anything
238:32
so i'll drop it now
238:34
i don't know
238:36
it's important to me too
238:37
i mean i'm also friends with her
238:40
and i also care about being the
238:42
well-being of my club members you know
238:44
maybe i'll try talking to myself
238:47
huh uh are you are you sure about that
238:50
she seemed like she wanted to be left to
238:51
learn
238:53
are you sure
238:55
maybe she's just having a hard time
238:56
bringing it up with the person of
238:57
interest
238:59
person of interest
239:01
what do you mean by that
239:03
i'm saying that maybe the thing is on
239:05
her mind is you luca
239:07
me
239:09
luxem is popular with webcam bots
239:17
what's going on guys what's going on
239:26
nothing okay all right we're good we're
239:28
good
239:29
all right how on earth would you come to
239:31
that conclusion
239:33
well well
239:34
i probably shouldn't say too much but
239:37
sayori talks about you more than
239:39
anything else you know
239:44
she's been so much happier ever since
239:45
you joined the club it's like an extra
239:48
light was turned on inside her
239:51
what
239:52
no way
239:53
sayori is always like that
239:56
she's always been full of sunshine
239:58
it's not any different now that
240:00
it has now that it always has been
240:05
you're so funny luka have you thought
240:08
that maybe you've always seen her as so
240:11
cheerful because that's just how she is
240:13
when she's around you
240:15
oh guys
240:19
[Music]
240:22
oh no i think i know
240:29
she's probably
240:33
she's probably like
240:34
depressed
240:36
and and
240:38
seeing me
240:41
is what lights her up
240:48
i said too much
240:52
i'm sorry what do i know anyway i didn't
240:55
mean to jump to conclusions so you
240:56
should just forget about what i said
240:59
okay
241:00
i try to talk to her so try not to think
241:02
about it for now ah
241:04
alright
241:06
monica smiles meaningfully
241:08
i know she said forget about it forget
241:10
about it
241:11
but i
241:12
i already know that i won't be able to
241:13
get her words out of my head
241:16
wanna get stands up from her desk and
241:18
walks across the room to where she yuri
241:20
is sitting
241:21
i watch her kneel down next to sayori
241:23
and i gently talk to her
241:26
she's keeping her voice so quiet that i
241:27
can't hear her from here
241:30
i
241:30
sigh and i sit myself down
241:41
i know sayori told me not to worry about
241:43
her and to have fun with everyone else
241:45
but that's impossible to do when she's
241:47
behaving like this
241:48
exactly how much do i care about her and
241:50
that i'm letting this weigh me down so
241:53
much
241:54
now it feels like i'm the one behaving
241:56
out of the ordinary
241:58
there's nothing i can do besides wait
241:59
for monica
242:00
why does it feel like i'm being watched
242:03
i glanced around the room
242:05
[Music]
242:08
i suddenly noticed yuri peeking it
242:10
ah
242:14
[Music]
242:18
but she looks away just as quickly with
242:20
a flustered look in her face
242:22
i realize that she won't get anywhere
242:24
like this
242:25
i've never really seen yuri approach
242:27
anyone to start a conversation
242:28
on her own accord
242:30
so i have no choice but to approach
242:32
myself
242:34
by now it's a little easier for me to do
242:36
that
242:37
i stand up at my desk and i sit one
242:39
seven one next to her own
242:47
i didn't mean to bother you anything
242:50
relax you didn't even do anything
242:53
but
242:54
i could tell that you wanted to be
242:55
aligned with your thoughts
242:57
along with my thoughts
242:59
how are you able to tell that i was
243:01
thinking like that
243:03
well
243:04
it's something that i do a lot
243:07
it
243:08
wasn't hard for me to spot based on your
243:10
posture and
243:12
expression
243:13
not that i was staring or anything
243:16
i didn't do anything creepy like that
243:19
in any case i guess you were right
243:22
oh i'm sorry i caused if i caused you
243:24
any concern
243:26
i apologize
243:28
your troubles are the only concern of
243:31
those who will willingly share that
243:34
your troubles are the only concern of
243:37
those
243:38
who willingly share in that concern
243:41
[Music]
243:44
of course there are certainly those who
243:47
find the most comforting keeping to
243:48
themselves
243:50
but if you would prefer to share what's
243:51
on your mind then i would be glad to
243:54
listen
243:55
and it's really not that big of a deal
243:58
i was just feeling a bit uneasy about
244:00
sayori
244:02
sayori
244:03
yeah she seems a little off today when i
244:05
asked her about it she didn't want to
244:06
admit it to me
244:07
so i can't help but wonder if something
244:09
happened to her
244:10
oh
244:11
that's quite romantic
244:13
oh
244:15
sorry
244:16
i didn't mean to say something so stupid
244:19
it's not that i just i don't want you to
244:21
misunderstand
244:23
sayori and i have been friends for a
244:25
long time that's all
244:27
i see
244:29
then perhaps it's unusual for her to be
244:32
so dismissive to you about your feelings
244:35
or maybe i'm just reading into it a
244:37
little too much
244:40
the world is full of meaning
244:43
often hidden deep beneath in plain sight
244:46
and there are so many untold mysteries
244:48
behind the person no matter how well you
244:51
know them
244:52
ah
244:54
do you think there might be something
244:56
behind it after all
245:00
i think that sayori is a very complex
245:02
person
245:03
her mannerism on the outside don't
245:05
always match what may be going on inside
245:07
her head
245:09
and she may not always know what she
245:11
wants
245:12
i notice her strange behavior today too
245:16
[Music]
245:18
i also feel some concern for her
245:20
but in your case it looked like she was
245:22
fully occupying with your thoughts
245:23
wasn't she
245:25
well
245:26
i guess that was the case
245:29
sayori she really means a lot to you
245:31
doesn't she
245:33
uh
245:34
i
245:34
i guess
245:36
but you don't need to put it that way
245:38
we're just good friends that's all
245:42
[Music]
245:44
suddenly looks deeply into my eyes
245:49
her expression is gentle and curious as
245:52
if she was searching for something
245:55
embarrassed i avert my gaze sometimes
245:58
sometimes
245:59
a person's mystery are untold even to
246:02
themselves
246:04
and you
246:05
as someone honest and caring
246:08
may uncover feelings you weren't aware
246:11
were in you
246:12
that is
246:13
i think that
246:14
she would be a very fortunate person
246:17
to have you
246:19
feel that way about her
246:21
yuri
246:22
you're giving me too much credit
246:24
i'm a pretty simple guy
246:26
so i think i'm pretty good at
246:28
understanding my own feelings
246:30
i'm not nearly as sophisticated as you
246:32
oh
246:34
that's not a compliment is it
246:36
it is what it was
246:41
so what
246:43
anyway anyway as long as we're here why
246:45
don't we do some reading
246:47
well
246:48
as long as you're okay with it
246:50
yeah
246:52
i should be taking my mind off this
246:54
whole thing anyway
246:59

your writing has only improved
270:16
in the last few days
270:18
your poem

every poem you've shown me has been
270:21
nothing short of spectacular
270:24
i can really feel the emotions
270:26
i'm a little envious even
270:28
i don't think it ever came to me
270:31
this naturally
270:34
yuri that's the wrong way to put it
270:40
wait do you guys want me to keep the hat

discover the
273:00
mysteries of life

275:40
but every time
275:42
you've always treated me just like
275:44
anyone else
275:46
it's so rare that i feel comfortable
275:48
with myself when i talk to others
275:52

275:54
every time i talk to you
275:56

the tendrils of my hair
277:44
wait the same one
277:46
the tendrils on my hair eliminate
277:48
beneath the amber glow
277:50
bathing in the distance a blue green
277:53
light flickers
277:54
alone bigger crosses with path a
277:57
silhouette obstructing the eerie glow
278:00
my heat pounds the silhouette close
278:03
glory grows
278:05
closer closer
278:08
i open my umbrella casting a shadow to
278:11
shield me from visibility
278:13
but i am too late
278:15
he steps into the street light i gasp
278:18
and i drop my umbrella
278:23
and the light flickers
278:26
my heart pounds he raises his arm
278:30
time stops
278:32
the only indication of movement is the
278:35
amber light flickering against his
278:37
outstretched arm
278:39
the flickering light is in rhythm with
278:41
the pounding of his heart
278:45
of my heart
278:48
teasing me from succumbing to his
278:50
forbidden version
278:52
what
278:54
[Music]
278:56
she's talking about me
278:57
have you ever heard of a ghost feeling
278:59
worth before
279:01
giving up on understanding i laugh
279:04
my understanding is overrated
279:07
i touch his hand
279:08
flickering the flickering stops
279:11

279:13
my heart
279:15
is amber
279:16
[Music]
279:19

279:25
looks away
279:27
do you dislike it
279:29
no no of course not
279:31
i just don't know how to
279:33
respond
279:35
it's my yuri's poems usually being
279:36
cryptic it wasn't hard to figure out
279:38
what this one's about
279:40
i i don't know if i'll be able to
279:42
explain this one
279:44
that's fine
279:45
i understand this one
279:50
yuri is having an even harder time
279:52
speaking than usual
279:55

280:00
i'm not really good with words but i'm
280:02

280:07
together
280:08
despite my inability to make eye contact
280:10
i see a faint smile emerging yuri's lips
280:16
oh i see it
280:19
i once again try to hand the poem back
280:22
but instead yuri
280:25
takes my hand and push and pushes them
280:28
back towards me
280:31

288:54
there you go
288:58
your style's going so refined luca
289:01
you have been teaching a lot of things
289:03
hasn't she
289:04
well
289:06
i guess sir yeah i've been noticing how
289:09
much time you've spent with her
289:12
and i've heard
289:13
i think i've heard her say
289:15
no more words these past couple of days
289:17
that she's taught in a whole
289:20
year not sure how you did it that's
289:23
pretty impressive
289:25
well she just needs some patience and a
289:27
way to talk about all the things in her
289:29
head i guess
289:30
i'm still getting the hang of it myself
289:33
he's certainly putting in a lot of
289:34
effort you must really like her
289:38
that's
289:41
it's awfully suspicious you know
289:44
spending time with her in the club room
289:45
every day
289:47
reading that edgy novel with her wow
289:51
i just feel bad that she has a hard time
289:53
socializing
289:56
it makes me want to make sure she
289:57
doesn't spend all the time alone kind of
289:59
sassy
290:01
besides the novel isn't too bad either
290:03
you know
290:04
all right all right
290:06
i got you
290:07
just be careful right
290:10
i know that yuri isn't
290:11
oh used to opening herself up
290:14
so if something bad happens while she's
290:15
vulnerable
290:18
and it could be it could be really hard
290:19
for her
290:21
her books aren't a total escape from
290:22
reality
290:24
it's just a bandage
290:26
ah you said i'm like i'm gonna hurt her
290:29
sorry i didn't mean it like that
290:31
if anything she might accidentally hurt
290:33
herself what
290:34
anyway
290:36
i'll share my point with you right now
290:38
right
290:40
all right
290:42
i'm kind of saucy right chad i'm kind of
290:45
sassy
290:48
the lady who knows everything
290:49
[Music]
290:51
an old tale taylor
290:53
tale tells of a lady who wanders earth
290:56
the lady who knows everything a
290:57
beautiful lady who has found every
290:59
answer
291:00
all meaning
291:01
all purpose and all that was ever sought
291:05
and here i am a feather
291:08
loss addressed the sky
291:09
victim of the current of the wind day
291:12
after day i search i search with little
291:15
hope knowing legends don't exist but
291:17
when all else has failed me
291:20
when all the others have turned away the
291:22
legend is all that remains the last dim
291:25
star glimmering glimmering in the
291:28
twilight sky
291:31
until one day
291:32
the wind ceases to blow
291:34
i fall
291:36
and i fall and fall and fall even more a
291:38
gentle as a feather a dry cool
291:40
expressionless
291:42
but a hand catches me between the thumb
291:44
and the forefinger
291:47
the hand of a beautiful lady
291:49
i look at her eyes and i find no end to
291:52
her gaze
291:54
the lady who knows everything knows what
291:55
i'm thinking before i can speak she
291:57
responds in a hollered voice
291:59
i have found every answer
292:02
all of which amount to nothing
292:04
there is no meaning there is no purpose
292:06
and we seek only the impossible
292:09
i am not your legend your legend does
292:11
not exist and with a breath she blows me
292:14
back afloat and i pick up a gust of wind
292:19
hug you
292:20
nice okay
292:22
you know
292:23
i feel like learning and looking for
292:25
answers are the sorts of things that
292:27
gave me life
292:28
meaning
292:30
not to get too far off a coloring or
292:33
anything
292:34
but
292:35
it was kind of
292:37
out of all my mind so that's what i
292:38
wrote about
292:40
i see
292:42
i never really put that much thought
292:44
into it
292:45
in a way
292:46
it's almost paradoxical
292:49
because if we had all the answers
292:51
wouldn't the world start to lose its
292:53
meaning
292:54
you know you know there's one thing i
292:56
noticed
292:57
it seems like everyone in the club
292:58
prefers writing about things that are
293:00
more sad than happy
293:03
are you surprised
293:05
i mean if everything was okay
293:07
we wouldn't really have anything right
293:09
about it would we
293:10
humans are aren't two dimensional
293:13
creatures
293:16
what
293:23
okay that's that's that's pretty sussy
293:25
that was pretty sussy
293:30
[Music]
293:32
i i uh i think you'd know that better
293:35
than anyone
293:36
you mean one dimensional
293:38
oh yeah that
293:40
anyway
293:42
here's monica's writing tip of the day
293:45
are you ever too shy to share your
293:46
writing because your fate is not that
293:48
good
293:49
it can be really disheartening to get a
293:51
lukewarm response to something you put
293:53
so much into
293:55
but if you find other people who enjoy
293:57
writing and sharing becomes a lot easier
294:01
because instead of just telling your
294:03
writing is good or okay or bad
294:06
i will want to focus more on everything
294:08
that went into it
294:09
and the things you can work on
294:12
it's much more encouraging that way and
294:15
it will make you want to continue
294:17
improving
294:18
it's almost like having your own little
294:21
literature literature club don't you
294:23
think
294:24
that's my advice for today
294:25
thanks for listening
294:30
okay
294:31
okay you three
294:33
we're all done sharing poems right
294:36
why don't we start figuring out
294:38
hold on a second
294:40
is it just me or did you say something
294:41
strangers now
294:43
huh
294:45
something could sound a bit unusual
294:47
that's right
294:49
you deviated yourself from your usual
294:50
crotch phrase when addressing the club
294:54
catchphrase
294:56
i don't have a catchphrase geez
294:59
why why is the mood so weird today
295:02
look even yuri isn't immune to it
295:06
stagnating air is common foreshadowing
295:08
that something terrible is about to
295:10
happen
295:12
in your books maybe
295:14
look the only thing different is that
295:16
sayori isn't here
295:18
oh
295:19
it seems you're right
295:20
oh
295:22
sayori always seems to line up the mood
295:24
a little bit doesn't she it's almost
295:26
like everyone's balance is thrown off a
295:27
little when she's not around
295:32
where the heck did she run off to anyway
295:34
i thought she just wants to pee
295:39
natsuki
295:40
please show some decency
295:42
oh come on
295:45
ah she actually wasn't feeling too well
295:48
and went home early
295:49
[Music]
295:51
is that so
295:53
i hope she's all right
295:55
seriously
295:56
of all the times not going home with her
295:58
you pick the time she's not feeling well
296:02
so much for youtubing all lovey-dovey
296:06
uh no first of all stop misunderstanding
296:09
my friendship with sayori
296:12
and second
296:13
he's kind of been avoiding me today and
296:15
i didn't want to force it
296:19
a curious expression coming from
296:23
wait what the curious expression coming
296:25
from yuri of all people
296:27
calm down guys
296:29
i talked to her earlier and everything
296:30
is fine
296:32
what did she say
296:33
anyway if we need to figure out the rest
296:34
of the festival preparation so let's
296:37
decide what what everyone will be doing
296:39
this weekend
296:40
i already know what i'm doing
296:43
that's right
296:44
oscar will be making cupcakes
296:46
but you might need a lot of them and
296:48
different flavors
296:50
can you handle all that by yourself
296:52
natsuki
296:53
challenge accepted
296:55
and as for myself
296:58
i'm going to be printing and assembling
297:00
all the poetry pamphlets pamphlets
297:03
sayori will be helping me design them
297:06
and as for yuri
297:08
here you can
297:09
[Music]
297:10
uh um
297:12
[Music]
297:13
nice
297:15
can you help me come up with something
297:17
for yuri
297:19
my
297:20
i'm useless
297:21
no
297:22
that's not it at all
297:24
you're the most talented person here you
297:26
know
297:28
now
297:31
now natsuki's pouting too
297:34
geez even i can tell now i guess i never
297:36
gave sayori enough credit
297:38
because i can tell
297:40
things are even harder on you
297:43
when she's not around
297:45
ah
297:46
that may be that may be the case
297:48
but
297:49
if i can't also be a leader on my own
297:51
then i won't go as a person
297:54
so yuri
297:55
you have beautiful handwriting you know
297:59
so you should make some bananas and
298:01
decorations to help set the atmosphere
298:04
atmosphere
298:06
um
298:07
about that
298:08
i love
298:10
i love
298:11
i love
298:12
atmosphere yuri's expression suddenly
298:15
changes as she stares at her desk in
298:17
focus and starts nodding to herself
298:19
your mind is already racing i see
298:21
that's great
298:23
you'll be wonderful help yuri
298:25
but anyway
298:27
that just leaves you luka
298:29
the one who is truly useless
298:33
oh wow
298:37
wait i said that who said that
298:40
wait oh i said that okay
298:44
i said that my bad
298:47
i said that whoops
298:48
[Music]
298:51
don't say that
298:53
in fact what's not skinny have some
298:55
pretty heavy tasks to handle
298:58
i would probably go a long way to give
299:00
one of them a hand
299:02
you could always help me out as well
299:04
i would really appreciate it be i would
299:06
be really appreciative of
299:09
ah
299:10
that's
299:12
is monica suggesting i spent
299:15
the weekend with one of my club members
299:18
how on earth are they gonna respond to a
299:20
suggestion like this
299:24
i suppose i wouldn't mind a bit of help
299:27
well
299:28
even if you don't know how to bait
299:29
there's always some dirty work i could
299:31
give to you
299:33
it's not like monica's gonna give me a
299:34
choice and he shouldn't be sitting on
299:37
your butt anyway
299:39
now let's keep trying some mumble and a
299:40
bunch of excuses like that
299:42
um
299:43
if i were kalonski you mentioned that
299:46
you would like to handle the baking on
299:47
your own
299:49
look it may not be not like to be around
299:52
he only make him out to be a nuisance
299:55
so therefore
299:57
he may be more suited to assisting with
299:59
the decorations
300:01
hold on
300:02
i never said that
300:05
guys what is this eye lip eye
300:10
what is this eye lip eye
300:13
what
300:18
what are you doing
300:24
[Music]
300:25
we're watching you what
300:27
guys up staring
300:31
[Music]
300:32
i never said that
300:34
how hard could it be to make a few
300:36
decorations anyway
300:38
sounds like you're just making an excuse
300:40
is for lukatsu
300:42
what are you saying
300:43
it will be extremely
300:45
meticulous work
300:47
and freaking isn't
300:50
it
300:51
guys guys
300:53
let's settle down for a moment in the
300:56
end i think it's up to luca to decide
300:58
how he'd like to contribute
301:00
besides
301:02
he hasn't really gotten the chance to
301:04
spend any time with me yet you know
301:07
so i'm sure he's interested in
301:09
you literally
301:11
i'm surprised as well
301:13
sorry sorry
301:16
what what is that what is this chat dude

305:38
i can already tell
305:40
you're about to say something mean
305:43
no
305:47
i was saying
305:50
not ski molding
305:53
[Music]
305:54
so
305:55
we'll be helping yuri anyway
305:58
yeah
305:59
that's what i'm gonna do
306:01
i'm glad
306:03
i
306:04
have a bad habit of overtaking
306:05
overthinking these sort of things
306:07
so i think your assistance will be very
306:10
useful
306:11
that's great to hear
306:12
natsuki
306:14
will you be able to handle baking by
306:15
yourself
306:16
i mean yeah
306:18
i already said i would
306:20
i would be fine
306:22
okay okay
306:24
everyone can tell that natsuki is
306:25
feeling a little sour she's molding
306:29
so is is everyone
306:31
is that everything we need to go over
306:34
that should be it
306:36
are you guys are you guys excited
306:38
well excited may not be the word right
306:40
now
306:41
i'm supposed i'm looking forward to it a
306:42
little bit
306:44
do you feel the same way luka me
306:47
uh i guess you could say i'm interested
306:50
see how it'll turn out
306:52
that's good enough for me
306:54
what about you natsuki
306:57
matsuki
306:59
what
307:01
why is everyone yelling at me
307:05
fine
307:08
they don't even do anything
307:13
no no
307:16
that's not what i meant at all
307:21
yuri anxiously glances before between
307:23
everyone in the room
307:25
i'm so sorry for this
307:28
i
307:29
don't really
307:31
no i luca picked me
307:33
and also
307:34
their cupcakes are the best cupcakes
307:37
i've ever had
307:38
good one good one yuri good one
307:42
they go really well with my tea
307:44
and
307:45
nothing that i do for the event will
307:47
compare to that so
307:50
so
307:51
i get it i get it
307:53
i'm kind of surprised though
307:56
what
307:57
um
307:58
oh
307:59
i'm no one acting immature
308:03
i already know that
308:06
i already know that
308:09
but you're trying to cheer me up all of
308:10
a sudden
308:11
i know i'm not very good at it
308:14
i'm sorry if i said something bad
308:16
husky's the only one
308:18
oscar isn't the only one surprised
308:20
monica naio is also taken aback by
308:22
yuri's words when she already has
308:24
trouble with words trying to cheer
308:26
someone up must be far out of her
308:28
comfort zone
308:31
but i begin to understand yuri was
308:33
trying to sound like sayori
308:35
even if it didn't sound didn't work
308:37
perfectly i can tell that she tried to
308:39
say something so yuri would say at a
308:40
time like this
308:41
because sayori
308:44
always helps everyone smile and feel
308:47
good about themselves

rosemary collab
309:20
[Music]
309:26
i hope to see everyone do their best
309:28
but with that
309:29
there's nothing more for today
309:31
i guess it's time for us to head out
309:34
all right let's get out of here then
309:37
everyone packs up their things
309:39
i start to follow monica natsuki out of
309:41
the door as they chat between each other
309:47
um
309:50
i turn around
309:52
sorry yuri chan
309:55
[Music]
309:59
i realized that i don't have any way of
310:03
i realized that i don't have any way of
310:04
contacting you this weekend
310:06
oh you're right
310:10
i can't i can't believe that flipped my
310:11
mind
310:12
[Music]
310:15
should i give you my phone number
310:17
[Music]
310:19
i think that would be the best way yes
310:23
all right then
310:25
yuri and i exchange phone numbers
310:29
okay
310:31
then i'll be stopping by your house on
310:33
sunday
310:35
huh
310:36
my house
310:38
is that a problem
310:40
no not at all
310:42
i just thought i'd be the one going to
310:45
your house and i'm the one helping you
310:51
oh
310:52
ah
310:52
i suppose that makes sense
310:55
but if you don't mind
310:57
i think i would prefer going to your
310:59
house
311:00
all right
311:01
in that case in that case oh my god i'm
311:04
mixing up the work
311:06
i'm mixing it up
311:07
[ __ ] won't be a problem
311:09
i decide not to press yuri for a reason
311:12
it's not like i should it should matter
311:14
how much
311:16
what is going on come on read read
311:18
normally
311:19
it's not like you should matter much
311:21
either way so i'll just need to make
311:22
sure that my room is clean
311:25
i hope i can manage to make myself
311:26
useful in some way
311:29
i'm not nearly as creative as you are
311:32
not underestimate yourself luca
311:34
i think that will make a very
311:36
productive team
311:38
even if you only choose me because you
311:40
felt bad or something
311:42
wait
311:44
you don't actually think that do you
311:46
i i don't know
311:48
it's difficult to come up with any other
311:50
reason you may have chosen me
311:53
you're forgetting the one reason with
311:54
the most common sense
311:57
i chose to help you
311:59
because i want
312:00
that's what i want to do
312:02
milady
312:05
tips hat
312:06
[Music]
312:12
but
312:14
yuri thinks to herself an extremely
312:16
tense expression
312:18
here yuri you're overthinking this
312:21
you wanted me to point out when you're
312:23
overthinking right
312:24
[Music]
312:26
i didn't realize i'm telling you i want
312:29
to
312:30
that's all there is to it you believe me
312:33
i
312:35
you really you really thinks really hard
312:38
again
312:39
she looked straight into my eyes for a
312:41
long while
312:43
i believe you
312:46
as if it took to mend this effort
312:49
yuri finally says that and relaxes her
312:52
expression
312:52
[Music]
312:54
and i'm really looking forward to sunday
312:56
yeah
312:57
i am too i am too oh
313:02
after that exchange i make my way out of
313:04
dawn yuri followers
313:05
[Music]
313:07
i'm walking on with yuri
313:11
curious going to be coming to my house
313:13
on sunday
313:14
[Music]
313:16
my anxiety shoots through the roof
313:19
even though i've gotten pretty used to
313:21
handling her at this point
313:22
there's no telling what might end up
313:25
happening when we're outside of school
313:27
more than that she told me that she was
313:29
looking forward to it
313:30
is this a chance that i have to make
313:32
something happen between us
313:33
or it's too early for that
313:35
only time will tell
313:37
until then i won't be able to take my
313:39
mind off of it
313:41
i seriously can't wait
313:43
uh
313:47
it's already sunday
313:52
it's been getting increasingly anxious
313:55
about yuri's upcoming visit
313:57
i keep telling myself there's no reason
313:59
to be nervous but it doesn't help much
314:02
yuri's clearly an introvert and
314:04
an intimate person in general
314:06
there's no doubt that she'll open up
314:09
a little bit and it's just the two of us
314:12
meanwhile we've been we've been we've
314:14
even been texting
314:16
occasionally
314:18
she was extremely apprehensive at first
314:21
but
314:22
it wasn't long before i was already
314:24
learning more about her
314:26
it's
314:27
totally i lip eye that's it so i i still
314:30
see that
314:33
but putting yuri aside
314:35
i haven't even
314:36
i haven't heard a thing from sayori
314:39
since she left
314:41
she loved the club
314:43
i need water
314:49
the other day
314:51
it's not like we we taxi
314:53
it's not like we text each other all the
314:54
time or anything
314:56
but i've been worried about her in the
314:57
back of my mind
314:58
between what sayori said and what monica
315:00
said
315:01
is it really okay for me to put sayori's
315:02
feelings aside when she might need me
315:05
[Music]
315:07
i decided i decided to visit sayori's
315:10
house
315:12
i decide to visit sayori before yuri
315:14
comes over okay rather than asking i
315:17
simply tell you i'm coming over
315:19
much like we've done in the past
315:22
once i reach sayori's house i knock on
315:24
the door before entering it myself
315:29
again we used to play so often we made
315:32
it a habit of simply entering each
315:34
other's houses like real family
315:37
the house is quiet
315:41
sayori isn't anywhere on the first floor
315:44
where's the music
315:46
so i assume she's
315:48
up in her room
315:50
it's already strange of her nuts let's
315:52
run down and greet me
315:54
i head up to her bedroom when i finally
315:56
find her
315:59
sayuri
316:01
hi luka
316:03
i i sit down in her room
316:06
sayori forces a smile but it's easy to
316:08
tell that she's different
316:10
it's a minute of silence between us
316:13
you haven't you haven't come over like
316:15
this in a long time have you
316:18
oh i guess you're right
316:20
it's been a long time oh god
316:23
not much has really changed has it
316:25
sayori's room is as messy as it's always
316:27
been
316:29
i also recognize the same stuffed
316:31
animals
316:32
[Music]
316:35
if he come over more often it wouldn't
316:37
be such a messy mess
316:41
that's because i end up clean cleaning
316:43
it up for you
316:45
okay how come you suddenly wanted to
316:47
come over today
316:48
are you supposed to see yuri today
316:51
yeah but
316:52
wait how did you know that
316:54
sayori had already left by the time we
316:57
decided that last meeting
316:59
monica told me
317:02
why
317:02
why
317:04
[Music]
317:08
it's only natural for her to keep me
317:10
informed about the festival perforations
317:12
right
317:12
[Music]
317:14
ah that's true
317:15
what about you
317:17
aren't you planning to be helping monica
317:18
today
317:19
of course
317:21
but i'm i'm just helping her online
317:24
we didn't plan to meet up or anything
317:27
ah so it's just me and yuri then
317:29
yep
317:30
there's more silence between us
317:33
so yuri stands in a random direction
317:37
every time about
317:38
everything about her behavior is really
317:40
uncorrect characteristic
317:42
i finally get to the point
317:46
i just wanted to see how you were doing
317:49
after you left on friday
317:51
when something's wrong
317:53
you can't hide it from me
317:55
i know you too well
317:57
sorry
317:58
sorry sorry smile shaking your head
318:04
no good luca
318:07
why can't it just be like it's always
318:09
been
318:10
it's all my fault
318:13
if i didn't get so weak and accidentally
318:15
express my feelings
318:17
if i didn't make that stupid mistake
318:21
and you wouldn't have been worried about
318:22
me at all
318:24
you wouldn't have come here
318:26
you wouldn't have been thinking about me
318:28
right now
318:29
but this is just my punishment isn't it
318:33
getting punished for being so selfish
318:36
i think that's why the world decided to
318:38
have you come over today
318:40
he just wants to torture me
318:46
sayori
318:48
i grabbed sayori by the shoulders
318:51
grab
318:52
[Music]
318:55
what an earth are you saying
318:58
are you listening to yourself right now
319:00
i know something happened to you
319:02
there's no other explanation for you to
319:04
be like this
319:05
to tell me already
319:07
until
319:08
until i know i won't be able to stop
319:10
thinking about it
319:13
[Music]
319:15
sayori
319:17
gives an empty smile
319:20
you really put me in a trap luca
319:23
[Music]
319:27
but
319:28
you're wrong
319:30
nothing happened to me
319:33
i've always been like this
319:35
you just seen her for the first time
319:38
seeing what
319:40
what are you talking about sayori
319:44
you're really just gonna make me say it
319:46
aren't you luca
319:51
you like me
319:52
i guess i have no choice this time
319:56
the thing is
319:58
i've had really bad depression my whole
320:00
life
320:01
oh no
320:03
did you know that
320:05
why do you think i'm late to school
320:06
every day
320:08
because most days i can't even find a
320:10
reason to get out of bed
320:13
what reason is there to do anything when
320:15
i fully know how worthless i am
320:18
why go to school
320:20
i eat
320:22
i make friends
320:24
why make other people put their energy
320:26
and caring to waste by having it spend
320:28
on me
320:30
that's what it feels like
320:33
and that's why i just want to make
320:34
everyone happy
320:37
without anyone worrying about me
320:40
[Music]
320:43
i'm in shock
320:45
i can't even figure out how to unders
320:47
how to respond
320:48
[Music]
320:50
how is it how is it possible that sayori
320:52
kept this from me the entire time i've
320:54
known her
320:55
did she really want so badly for me to
320:58
just not think about her
321:01
why say worry
321:04
why is it that you've never told me
321:05
about this
321:06
it almost feels like i've been betrayed
321:09
as your close friend
321:11
because if i knew i would have done
321:13
everything like that is a bad thing to
321:16
say
321:17
no never say this chad never say this
321:22
never say this
321:24
never say that
321:28
never say that
321:29
[Music]
321:33
never say that
321:34
that is bad
321:38
is that now she's going to be like oh
321:41
you're you're only trying to support me
321:42
because i have depression that i need to
321:45
be supported
321:47
you know not because you want to do it
321:49
in the first place it's just because i
321:51
have because i'm struggling
322:00
yep
322:06
even if there's only so much that i
322:07
could do
322:08
i would have tried a little bit harder
322:10
to make everything every day a little
322:11
better for you
322:14
[Music]
322:17
that's why i'm your friend
322:19
all you had to do was tell me
322:22
you don't understand at all luca
322:24
why do you think i didn't tell you
322:28
because if i told you you would have to
322:29
waste your effort caring about me
322:31
instead of doing important things
322:35
i don't want to be cared about
322:37
it's bittersweet when people try to care
322:39
about me
322:41
it feels nice sometimes but it also
322:44
feels like a bed being swung against my
322:46
head
322:49
that's why i wanted so badly for you to
322:51
make friends with everyone else
322:53
helping everyone be happy together is
322:55
the best thing for me
322:58
[Music]
323:00
but then i discovered something else too
323:03
seeing you make friends
323:05
and get closer with everyone in the club
323:08
we'll talk luca thank you no problem
323:12
it feels like a spear going through my
323:14
heart
323:16
so that's that's why
323:18
that's why i decided the world just
323:20
wants to torture me
323:22
every past leads to nothing but hurt
323:28
you're right that i don't understand
323:31
i don't understand your feelings at all
323:32
sayori
323:34
i don't need to understand
323:36
whatever it takes for me to help you to
323:38
stop hurting
323:39
that's what i'll do
323:41
oh luca
323:43
there's nothing
323:46
yeah so the best the best thing you can
323:48
really just do is
323:50
treat them like you've always been doing
323:53
nothing at all
323:57
[Music]
324:00
the only thing that could have helped is
324:03
everything could have
324:04
could be like it always
324:06
was that was selfish
324:09
[Music]
324:11
i finally showed you what a horrible
324:13
person i am
324:15
no
324:15
[Music]
324:17
tears straight down sayori's face
324:24
literature club because i was selfish
324:28
and i was punished by my heart hurting
324:30
in the way that i couldn't understand
324:34
and now
324:36
you came here
324:38
i made you hurt too
324:39
[Music]
324:41
i'm just waking so much
324:44
that's all i am
324:47
and that's why i'm gonna accept these
324:48
punishments
324:50
because i deserve every
324:52
last
324:54
one
324:57
without thinking i once grab
325:00
i once again grab sayori's shoulders
325:05
this time i pull her into a tight
325:06
embrace
325:07
[Music]
325:12
look at her
325:13
so you worry
325:15
i don't care if you feel selfish i'm
325:18
really happy that you convinced me to
325:19
join the club
325:21
seeing you every day
325:22
makes it worthwhile enough
325:25
if i make friends with everyone else
325:26
then it's just a bonus
325:29
but please
325:30
never underestimate how much i care
325:32
about you
325:34
i wouldn't have it any other way
325:37
[Music]
325:39
sayori isn't hugging me back
325:41
despite my arms being wrapped around her
325:43
so sayori's arms remain at her side
325:46
[Music]
325:48
she starts sobbing next to my ear
325:51
no
325:52
[Music]
325:53
don't do this to me
325:55
[Music]
325:56
please
325:59
don't do this
326:01
oh god
326:04
hi
326:08
so you already barely manages to speak
326:10
between her sobs
326:12
i don't know if i'm doing the right
326:14
thing
326:15
but all i want is for her to know that i
326:17
care
326:19
if you have it in you to call yourself
326:20
selfish
326:22
then you have to let me be selfish too
326:25
no matter what it takes
326:27
i'll figure out what needs to change
326:30
i'll make these feelings go away
326:33
and if there's anything that you need me
326:35
to do
326:36
you better tell me
326:38
i'll get mad if you don't
326:43
i don't know
326:46
i don't know
326:47
i don't know
326:51
gently sayori puts her arms around me in
326:53
return
326:54
i don't know anything
326:57
it's
326:58
really scary
327:00
[Music]
327:02
i don't understand any of my feelings
327:04
like
327:05
[Music]
327:07
the only time i'm not feeling nothing is
327:10
when i'm feeling pain
327:13
but
327:15
it hugs us so warm
327:19
and that's really scary too
327:24
sayoni lets me go
327:26
and she does so
327:27
i let her go as well
327:30
the festival's tomorrow
327:32
yeah yeah
327:34
it's it's ah it's going to be fun
327:36

328:01

328:07
[Music]
328:12

328:37
at the very least do you want to come
328:39

328:46
i'm sorry
328:48
i don't know if
328:50
i would be a very
328:51
[Music]
328:54
if yeah if it would be very good for me
328:58
you understand
328:59
right
329:00
ah
329:02
it's kind of hard for me to fully
329:04
understand
329:05
but i'm trying my best
329:07
it's okay
329:09
don't worry too much about it
329:11
i'll see you tomorrow okay

329:15
i look forward to it
329:22
i say goodbye to sayori and exit the
329:25
house
329:26
on the way home i find myself still
329:28
feeling uneasy but it's hard for me to
329:31
keep thinking about it when yuri's about
329:33
to come over too
329:35
i think sayori is right
329:37
i shouldn't be worrying too much and
329:39
we're definitely going to have a great
329:40
time tomorrow
329:42
i should just focus on what's ahead of
329:43
me
329:44
[Music]
329:48
as i approach my house
329:50
i see something that makes me feel a
329:52
moment of panic
329:57

i'm sorry i wasn't home yet
330:52
were you waiting for a long time
330:55
no i just got here
330:57
but i started to get really nervous when
330:59
no one was answering the doorbell
331:02
you could have always texted me
331:05
if i had known i would have reassured
331:07
and hurried home
331:10
i suppose that's true
331:12
i didn't think of that for some reason
331:14
it should be a common sense to do that
331:16
but it's science ignore it
331:18
anyway let's go inside
331:22
i see you brought a lot of stuff with
331:23
you
331:24
boss did i save yet nope
331:27

331:28
[Music]
331:33

331:37
uh and did you manage to find everything
331:39
i asked you to buy as well
331:41
yeah pretty much
331:43
at least i hope i got everything right
331:46
i'm sure it will be fine
331:47
[Music]
331:50
yuri time
331:53
the first thing she does is glance
331:54
around curiously which makes me feel
331:56
anxious
331:58
it's so clean
332:01
it cleaner before you came over sir
332:04
that's very considerate of you to do
332:08
oh no
332:10
i would have i would be really
332:12
embarrassed for my room to be a mess
332:14
while you were here
332:16
well i do enjoy cleaning
332:18
i would have gladly helped you clean
332:21
uh
332:22
that would have been even more
332:23
embarrassing
332:25
wait don't look in there
332:26
i snatched yuri's wrist which was the
332:28
pro in the process of opening a desk
332:30
drawer of mine
332:34
i'm sorry
332:36
i wasn't thinking for some reason
332:38
i was just spacing out
332:39
it's fine it's fine
332:41
i like of yuri's wrist
332:43
she puts both of her hands firmly on her
332:45
lap as if making sure she's keeping
332:46
track of them
332:49
so um
332:50
should we get started
332:52
yeah
332:55
um i have a few things planned that you
332:57
can help with
332:58
decorations and atmospheric enhancements
333:01
atmospheric enhancements
333:03
you know
333:04
mood lighting and aromatherapy handles
333:07
oh wow
333:09
i don't know you plan on taking it this
333:11
far
333:12
of course
333:14
i want to help i want to help take our
333:17
guests to a far away place
333:19
although many will stop by just out of
333:21
curiosity
333:22
and for cupcakes i guess
333:25
i'm determined to provide an experience
333:27
that will leave them wanting more
333:29
that's great
333:31
it's easy to forget you're pretty
333:32
intense person
333:33
ah ah
333:35
intense
333:36
i guess that's the best way to put it
333:38
is that a bad thing
333:40
no not at all
333:42
it's something that i like about you
333:44
actually
333:45
i lip eye i lip eye i lip eye
333:49
is that so
333:50
i mean that makes me feel relieved
333:53
i'm kind of happy
333:54
[Music]
333:56
no need to be so anxious
333:58
you can relax a little
333:59
relax
334:02
i put some
334:04
i brought some things for relaxation
334:07
i was going to use them during the
334:09
poetry event
334:10
oh yeah like what
334:12
let's see
334:13
yuri rummages through her bag
334:15
she pulls out a few candles and a few
334:17
cylinder-shaped objects
334:19
i did some shopping on the way here
334:22
so i happen to have these in my bag
334:25
i plan to cover the windows in black
334:26
paper
334:27
and use candles to light the room
334:30
i think that would be amazing don't you
334:32
yeah that would be really neat
334:34
and
334:35
what's that wooden thin thing though
334:37
oh this
334:38
it's a diffuser for essential oils
334:42
how familiar are you with aromatherapy
334:45
not familiar at all
334:46
is that so
334:48
it's one of my favorite contributors to
334:50
positive atmosphere
334:53
dude what is she talking about i don't
334:56
know what i've just read the past like
334:58
minute
334:59
depending on the oils or herbs you
335:01
choose you can change the middle of the
335:02
year itself
335:04
[Music]
335:06
you can even feel it permeate through
335:07
your body
335:09
relaxation positive energy
335:12
romance and reflection
335:15
it's almost like magic
335:17
yuri takes the cylinder pushes and
335:19
pushes the switch on the bottom in a
335:21
moment a thin ray of vapor begins to
335:23
spawn through a small hole in the top
335:26
well
335:28
it smells wonderful
335:29
what kind of mood is that one for
335:31
this jasmine essential oil
335:34
it smells a little sweet and flowery
335:36
right
335:37
yeah that's a good way to describe it
335:40
i chose jasmine for the event because it
335:42
provides me more relaxation
335:45
jasmine enhances your emotions and makes
335:47
helps you feel
335:49
and flow through your body
335:51
you feel warmer and your heart bounds
335:53
more heavily
335:54
don't you think it will be perfect for
335:56
sharing our poems
335:57
[Music]
335:59
it does sound suitable
336:02
but you seem to know a lot about this so
336:04
i'll trust your opinion with anything
336:07
yuri gently smiles clearly enjoying
336:09
herself
336:12
she again reaches into her bag and pulls
336:14
out several spools of
336:17
ribbon
336:18
what are those for oh did you purchase
336:20
the origami paper i asked you again
336:23
yeah i have it right here
336:26
you won't be using the paper folding
336:27
origami
336:29
what i'd like to do is write different
336:31
words on each paper
336:33
we'll need about 100 of them oh yeah
336:36
well what will those be used for
336:39
well i'm going to cut pieces of ribbon
336:41
to hang from the doorway of the
336:43
classroom
336:44
then we can fasten the paper
336:47
onto the ribbon to create a doorway for
336:51
a curtain
336:54
wouldn't that be beautiful
336:58
it would also catch the eye of passing
337:00
by the room
337:02
it may attract some people to peek
337:05
inside
337:07
that's really creative
337:09
i had no idea you were so good at this
337:11
yuri
337:13
is that so
337:15
what's getting sad i i'm just like
337:21
the fact that they're explaining
337:23
in detail
337:24
how they're gonna make it is just ah
337:28
i'm getting so distracted
337:30
[Music]
337:41
no thoughts head empty
337:43
that's all
337:44
well i suppose i do get a little intense
337:46
as you put it
337:48
yuri giggles with red cheeks
337:50
is it just me or is she more relaxed
337:53
when it's just the two of us
337:54
[Music]
337:58
fog
338:00
or maybe it seeks my assignment she
338:01
feels from sharing something she enjoys
338:04
here's a marker luca
338:06
you can write any characters you want
338:09
i'll help you once i finish cutting the
338:11
ribbons
338:12
oh all right
338:14
sitting on the floor together the two of
338:15
us get to work
338:17
i carefully draw a different character
338:19
on each paper
338:20
doing my best to manage my bad
338:22
handwriting
338:23
[Music]
338:26
yuri unravels as a long strand of red
338:29
ribbon
338:31
yup then she reaches into her bag once
338:34
more and pulls out a pocket knife
338:36
huh
338:38
the knife is strangely beautiful the
338:40
silver handle has an intricate pattern
338:42
of waves etched into it
338:45
the blade itself is gently tinted blue
338:47
oh
338:48
cool that's no that's no ordinary pocket
338:52
knife
338:52
it looks really fancy
338:55
oh
338:57
embarrassed yuri looks away
339:00
what is it
339:02
you own you're going to think it's weird
339:05
yuri whatever it is i have no reason to
339:07
judge
339:08
to each their own you know
339:10
if you promise you won't be weirded out
339:14
yeah i promise yeah i promise
339:16
all
339:16
right the thing is i'm kind of into
339:18
knives
339:19
and they're just so
339:22
pretty
339:23
i can't help it
339:25
i don't know what it is
339:27
the combination of craftsmanships and
339:29
feeling of danger
339:30
maybe
339:32
oh
339:33
what am i saying
339:35
please don't think i'm weird for this
339:38
[Music]
339:40
you're laughing at me
339:42
no i'm not laughing at you it's just
339:44
funny how nervous you got without
339:45
sharing
339:47
it's well
339:48
it's an interesting thing to be into i
339:50
guess
339:51
but i think it kind of suits you is it's
339:53
me
339:54
yeah it kind of it's kind of intense
339:58
besides it's really cool looking it's a
339:59
really cool looking knife i can't deny
340:01
that
340:02
it is isn't it
340:05
he really relaxes her expression once
340:07
again
340:08
would you like to hold it
340:10
sure
340:11
i'll check it out
340:13
okay
340:14
hold on guys
340:17
[Music]
340:21
i have nothing to simulate ads
340:32
i'll just pretend
340:34
oh thanks
340:36
[Music]
340:39
i take it and turn
340:40
around in my hands
340:43
it feels heavy
340:45
extremely solid
340:47
why'd you even get a knife like this
340:49
curious of its sharpness i feel the
340:51
point of the finger with my index finger
340:54
oh look huh
340:56
how would you do that
340:58
i didn't expect it to be that job
341:01
i barely touched it at all
341:03
it's my fault
341:05
i should have warned you
341:06
this knife is extremely sharp
341:09
you can cut skin like paper
341:11
oh no
341:12
a small drop of blood trickles down the
341:14
side of my finger
341:15
yuri takes my hand and gives the wound a
341:18
closer look
341:20
she stands at it and noticeably fidgets
341:24
if you're squeamish i'll go wash it off
341:26
right now
341:28
oh
341:29
without warning yuri puts my finger in
341:31
her mouth and looks
341:32
like someone what
341:38
i feel
341:38
[Music]
341:40
i feel her tongue curl up around my
341:42
fingers
341:44
startled
341:45
i
341:46
instinctively pulled my hand back
341:50
oh
341:52
please forgive me
341:55
i wasn't thinking
341:57
i hit
341:58

[Music]

342:26
little
342:27

342:30

[Music]
343:22
i knew that would be a bad idea
343:25

343:26
jasmine oil the air would be extremely
343:28
heavy right now
343:30
it's so weird luca

345:54
if you fill the cups too much it will be
345:56
too diluted
345:57
[Music]
346:01
taking yuri's advice i decided to use a
346:03
small plastic bathroom cups rather than
346:05
full size classes
346:07
you deserve it ah thank you guys
346:11
thank you so much
346:12
i appreciate it you know
346:15
[Music]
346:18
you
346:20
i put them on the plate to catch any
346:21
paint that trips and bring and bring it
346:24
back to my room
346:26
yuri
346:29
yeah that's too generous though thank
346:31
you so much
346:34
yes
346:37
i come in to see yuri quickly unrolling
346:39
her sleeve pulling it back down over
346:42
pulling it back over her arm
346:44
ah
346:45
nothing your face is a little red
346:47
is it too hot in here or anything
346:50
not at all
346:51
there's nothing wrong so
346:53
let's mix the paint
346:56
yuri hardly dismisses me and takes it
346:59
upon herself to unwrap the tablets
347:01
dropping them into cups
347:03
so
347:05
i thought we would do something simple
347:06
from
347:07
that would look very nice
347:09
i'd like to paint a gradient across a
347:11
banana
347:12
starting with the colors for sunrise and
347:14
daytime then sunset and night time
347:17
once it dries i'll write an
347:19
inspirational quote across the banner we
347:22
can hang it on the wall
347:24
behind the podium at the front of the
347:25
classroom
347:26
ah neat what are you gonna write
347:29
well
347:30
it would be more fun to surprise you
347:32
yuri smiles at me
347:35
if he says if you say so
347:37
after rolling out the banner you and i
347:39
yuri and i kneel on the opposite side so
347:41
we don't get
347:42
in the way of each other
347:44
yuri bro uses a brush
347:46
and adds a few dots of different colors
347:48
across the banner
347:50
this kind of reminds me of elementary
347:51
school
347:55
it's relaxing
347:56
oh
347:57
i'm sorry if this feels too childish no
347:59
i didn't mean that at all it's kind of
348:01
fun you know yeah
348:03
it is fun
348:04
i'm glad you feel that way too
348:06
yuri stops painting for a moment
348:07
thinking to herself
348:09
for me i don't need to go ahead and do
348:11
crazy things to have fun
348:13
in fact
348:14
i usually don't even want to
348:16
it's just like when i can spend time
348:18
with one other person
348:20
even if it's something simple like
348:22
reading
348:23
it doesn't even matter if you talk too
348:24
much
348:28
but just having a friend next to me
348:30
makes me feel a little bit nicer
348:33
i think that's all it takes for me to be
348:35
happy
348:36
is that so even if yuri and i are quite
348:39
different
348:40
i can understand where she's coming from
348:42
i feel that way about things like anime
348:45
games but simply sharing the experience
348:47
with someone can make me happy
348:49
true
348:52
i think i feel the same way
348:54
you really smart smile something
348:57
i knew you would understand
348:59
yuri leans over the banner to grab an
349:01
unused paintbrush
349:04
but i move at the same time causing my
349:06
head to bump into us yeah
349:09
sorry
349:12
yuri reels back and i quickly left my
349:14
hands in my
349:15
surprise
349:16
[Music]
349:17
are you hurt
349:20

349:21

349:23

349:25

349:25
[Music]
349:26

349:29
it for me
349:31

349:35
paint on yuri's face and neck
349:37

349:38
something in my face
349:40
[Music]
349:41

349:46

349:48
i rush out and fetch a small towel and
349:50
then dampen it with hot water
349:52
[Music]
349:54
i return to my room and i kneel back ah
349:58

350:00

350:04

350:29
towel
350:33
something wrong
350:34

350:36
i just didn't expect it
350:38
sorry
350:40
i didn't want to use the cold water
350:44
having finished i start to retract my
350:47
hand
350:48
but yuri suddenly holds my wrist
350:51
wait
350:53
huh
350:54
just for a little while longer
350:57
it feels really nice
350:59
what the ah
351:01
i keep my hand still against yuri's neck
351:04
she looks into my
351:06
eyes
351:08
it's an extend it's an intense
351:10
expression
351:12
that i recognize from when she reads her
351:14
books
351:15
almost as she's lost in a daze enveloped
351:19
by her own thought
351:22
yuri
351:24
she breathes gently half
351:27
through her
351:28
half through slightly past
351:32
this happening
351:34
is it the aroma of the jasmine oil
351:36
giving me this dizzy feeling
351:38
yuri's gentle feeling fingers wrapped
351:40
around my wrist
351:42
send me instead of tingling sensation
351:44
through my arm
351:47
guys i'm flush face emojiing
351:54
suddenly her face seems to be much
351:55
closer to mine than it was a moment ago
351:58
[Music]
352:02
yuri slowly pulls away
352:05
sorry
352:06
i've been feeling a little hot
352:08
lightheaded today
352:10
i didn't mean to space out
352:13
it's fine
352:19
[Music]
352:26
[Laughter]
352:28
[Music]
352:34
the moment is over as soon as it began
352:36
yuri picks up her brush again
352:38
but her movements seem clumsier
352:41
like she's unable to focus
352:43
i remain silent forced to ignore
352:46
the event that just transpired
352:48
[Music]
352:50
i hesitantly retrieve my own retrieve
352:54
my own brush and conceal
352:56
continue following your viewers example
353:00
let's do it
353:03
i finished feeling the night sky with
353:04
white dots that look like stars
353:07
looking at the banner as a whole it's
353:08
very pretty and natural looking
353:11
i think it come out came out better than
353:13
i
353:13
i think it came out better like ah
353:17
[Music]
353:23
i think it came out better than i
353:24
expected
353:26
i'm really happy with the results
353:28
yeah me too
353:30

353:32
[Music]
353:33
the lettering now
353:34
uh not yet
353:35
[Music]
353:37
he needs to dry first
353:39
that's true but won't that take a while
353:41
well
353:42
perhaps it would be best to leave it
353:44
here then have you bring it up in the
353:45
morning
353:47
i can do the lettering in the classroom
353:48
before our event starts
353:51
is that okay
353:53
that's totally fine
353:54
wonderful
353:55
in that case
353:57
i don't think there's anything more for
353:58
us to do here
353:59
[Music]
354:02
you say you say that like you're glad
354:04
it's over
354:06
was i wrong to assume that you're at
354:08
least enjoying yourself a little bit
354:11
oh no it's not that i'm just glad that
354:14
we managed to get everything done
354:16
i see
354:18
i am too
354:19
i was a little concerned about time
354:22
i need to start making dinner soon
354:24
uh
354:26
you don't have any time left
354:30
man
354:31
i was secretly hoping we would have
354:33
extra time after finishing the work
354:37
well
354:42
thinks to herself
354:44
i think it would be too responsible for
354:46
me to wait much longer
354:49
i'm sorry
354:51
i was hoping there would be more time as
354:53
well
354:54
it's probably my fault
354:57
sorry for being such a slow worker
354:59
oh it's not your fault at all
355:01
and the important thing is is that we
355:03
got everything done right
355:04
yeah
355:06
so
355:07
i shouldn't be disappointed or anything
355:11
gathering all her things yuri seems to
355:13
look a little damn cast
355:14
i understand why
355:16
sounding like she really gets the
355:17
opportunity to spend time with friends
355:19
in a relaxed environment
355:22
it's fine you have the next weekend
355:24
[Music]

355:27
can happen

366:27
we're being so selfish
366:28
so please
366:33
please don't worry about these stupid
366:35
feelings
366:37
i know you're right
366:38
i knew this whole time but there's no
366:40
happiness down that path
366:42
[Music]
366:45
no
366:46
that's not that's not what i mean
366:52
that's why i came here
366:53
[Music]
366:55
so i could get the answer i needed to
366:57
hear
366:58
and the other thing
367:00
you're also right that i just wanted to
367:02
go back the way it was
367:05
i realized that now
367:07
i really do know me better than anyone
367:09
look
367:12
oh
367:13
that's cute with anything
367:15
anything at
367:16
home so
367:21
[Music]
367:22
[Laughter]
367:29
clenching her head with both hands she
367:31
screams as loudly as she can
367:37
i i got that they're going to hear me
367:40
oh my gosh it's going to hear me
367:46
i'm so shocked i don't know how to react
367:49
[Music]
367:55
so he already looks over her shoulder
367:56
and flashes me one more weak smile
367:58
before turning around and running off
368:02
sayori
368:06
i'm left helplessly standing
368:09
in front of the house
368:12
why don't you why am i feeling so
368:13
horrible about this
368:15
there's nothing more that i could have
368:17
done
368:18
the most i can do is support sayori
368:20
through her feelings and help her on
368:21
that path
368:24
that's right
368:27
but i'm having as much trouble
368:28
understanding it
368:30
sayori's feeling as she is
368:32
even though i can comfort her
368:35
i keep wondering if i should be doing
368:38
something more or something different
368:41
i know these thoughts will continue to
368:43
plague me until
368:44
things are back to the way that
368:46
it used to be
368:48
i'm going to give it everything i've got
368:52
sayori will always be my dearest friend
368:55
and i'll do whatever it takes to put a
368:57
smile on her face every day
369:01
hey asama thank you so much for the 55
369:04
dollars hi luca i love the hat you
369:07
shared the time is late i go to bed
369:09
first enjoy your time good night
369:16
okay it's the day of the festival
369:19
of all days
369:21
i expected this to be the one where i'd
369:24
be walking to school with sayori
369:26
but sayori isn't
369:28
answering her phone
369:30
i considered going to her house wake her
369:33
up but i decided it's a little too much
369:35
it's probably just sad
369:40
meanwhile the preparations for the event
369:41
should be nearly complete
369:43
the banner yuri and i painted this dry
369:45
and i gently rolled it up to take with
369:47
me
369:48
she sent me a pleasant text reminding me
369:50
to not forget anything
369:52
i reassured her
369:54
funnily enough
369:56
i probably feel the same way as natsuki
369:58
about the about the event
370:00
i'm more excited for it to be over so i
370:03
can spend time with sayori and yuri at
370:04
the festival but knowing monica
370:09
but knowing monica i'm sure the event
370:11
will be great too
370:15
luca
370:16
you're the first one here
370:18
thanks for being so early
370:20
that's funny i would at least yuri would
370:22
be here by now
370:25
monica's placing a little booklet on
370:27
each of the desks in the classroom
370:29
where's the music
370:34
they must be the ones she prepared that
370:35
she have all the problems with
370:37
performing
370:39
in the end i found a random poem online
370:42
that i thought monica would like and
370:44
submitted it
370:45
so that's the one i'll be performing
370:49
i'm surprised you didn't bring sayari
370:51
sayori with you
370:53
yeah she overslept again
370:55
that dummy
370:57
you think that on days this important
370:59
she'd try a little harder
371:01
i say that but i suddenly remember what
371:03
you already saw you [ __ ] idiot why
371:05
would you say that
371:07
i suddenly feel awful knowing it's not
371:10
early
371:11
that simple for her it's not nearly that
371:14
simple for her i only said it because
371:17
that's it's the only way i'm used to
371:18
thinking
371:20
but
371:22
maybe i should have gone to wake her up
371:23
after all
371:26
you should take a little responsibility
371:28
for her luca i mean especially after
371:31
exchange for her yesterday
371:35
he kind of left her hanging in the
371:36
morning you know
371:37
how does she know
371:39
exchange
371:41
monica you know about that
371:43
of course i do
371:44
i'm the club president after all
371:47
but
371:48
i stammer embarrassed did sayori really
371:51
tell her about that
371:53
about it that quickly
371:56
about how i basically turned down her
371:57
confession
371:59
it makes me really seem like the bad guy
372:01
here
372:02
but i'm the one who knows what's best
372:03
for her right
372:05
and jeez
372:07
you know
372:08
you don't know the full story at all so
372:10
don't worry
372:12
i probably know a lot more than you
372:15
why should be so weird but it should be
372:18
so creepy
372:20
huh
372:22
monica's being as friendly as usual for
372:24
some reason i [ __ ] chill down my spine
372:26
after hearing that
372:28
hey
372:29
you want to check out
372:31
pamphlets
372:32
it came out really nice
372:34
yeah sure
372:35
i grabbed one of the pamphlets lay down
372:36
on the desk
372:38
oh yeah they really did
372:40
something like this will definitely help
372:42
people take the club more seriously
372:45
ah i thought so too
372:48
i flipped through the pages
372:50
each member's poems is neatly printed on
372:52
its own page giving it an almost
372:55
professional feel
372:56
i recognize natsuki's and yuri's poems
372:59
from the ones they performed during our
373:00
practices
373:02
what's this
373:03
i flipped to saryori's poem
373:06
where's the sound what's the sound
373:10
it's different from the one she
373:11
practiced
373:12
it's
373:13
one that i haven't read before
373:19
get out of my head get out of my head oh

374:10
what i know is best for you
374:12
get out of my head before i listen to
374:14
everything she said to me
374:18
out of my head
374:19
before i show you how much i love you
374:22
get out of my head before i finish
374:23
writing this poem
374:25
but a poem is never actually finished
374:29
it just stops moving what
374:33
what
374:36
oh
374:37
what is this
374:39
reading the poem i get a
374:40
pit in my stomach
374:43
luka
374:44
what's wrong uh
374:46
nothing
374:48
this poem feels completely different
374:49
from everything sayori's written
374:53
but more than that
374:54
i changed my mind
374:56
i'm going to get sayori sir
374:59
oh
375:00
well all right
375:02
i had to take too long okay
375:05
i quickly
375:06
leave the classroom
375:17
don't strain yourself
375:20
monica calls that out after me
375:22
i quicken my pace
375:27
what was i thinking
375:29
i should have tried a little bit harder
375:30
for sayori
375:32
it's not a big deal no way guys there's
375:36
no way she's
375:38
it's not a big deal to at least wait for
375:40
her
375:41
wake her up
375:44
oops
375:50
second chat we go
375:54
even a simple gesture of walking out of
375:55
school makes her really happy
375:57
besides
375:59
i told her yesterday that things will be
376:00
the same as they've always been
376:02
that's all she needs and what i want to
376:04
give to her
376:08
i reached sauri's house and knock on the
376:10
door
376:13
i don't expect an answer she's not since
376:16
she's not picking up the phone either
376:18
like yesterday i opened the door and let
376:19
myself in
376:21
the dedication to the performance
376:25
sayori
376:30
she really is a heavy sleeper
376:32
i swallow
376:34
i swallowed
376:38
sorry guys
376:42
i can't believe i ended up doing this
376:43
after all
376:45
waking up in her
376:46
waking up in her own house
376:50
isn't that more like something a
376:51
boyfriend would do
376:54
in any case
376:56
it just feels right
376:58
outside sayori's room i knock on their
377:00
door
377:03
so hurry
377:05
wake up dummy
377:07
there's no response
377:09
guys there's no way
377:14
it can't be what i'm thinking
377:18
i really didn't want to have to enter a
377:20
room like this
377:24
isn't that kind of a breach of privacy
377:28
she leaves me no choice
377:30
i gently open the door
377:32
[Music]
377:39
[ __ ] me
377:41
why was that so sudden
377:43
whoa no
377:46
[Music]
377:52
what
377:56
[Music]
378:03
no
378:06
guys what the [ __ ]
378:07
[ __ ]
378:09
why
378:10
[Music]
378:16
yeah
378:17
chad there was a warning earlier
378:20
at the beginning of the stream
378:22
i think this is it
378:24
no it's because of me
378:29
[Music]
378:37
what the hell
378:40
what the hell
378:42
is this a nightmare it has to be
378:45
this isn't real
378:47
there's no way this can be real
378:49
sayori wouldn't do this
378:52
everything was normal up until a few
378:53
days ago
378:58
me
379:00
that's why i can't
379:02
believe what my eyes are showing me
379:06
i suppress
379:08
urge to vomit
379:12
just like yesterday
379:14
i told sayori i would be there for her
379:20
then why
379:21
why would you do this
379:23
how could i be so helpless
379:25
what did i do wrong
379:27
turning down her confession
379:29
this has to be has to have been what
379:31
pushed her over the edge
379:33
the agonized scream still echoes in my
379:36
ears
379:37
why did i do that to her when she needed
379:39
me the most
379:45
why was i so selfish
379:49
this is my fault
379:51
my swarming thoughts keep telling me
379:53
everything i could
379:54
have done to prevent this
379:56
if i had to spend more time with her
379:59
walked out of school
380:00
[Music]
380:01
gave her what i know
380:03
she wanted out of our relationship
380:06
then i could have prevented this
380:07
[Music]
380:09
i know i could have prevented this
380:11
[Music]
380:13
screw the literature club
380:15
[Music]
380:17
screw the festival
380:21
i just lost my best friend
380:24
when i grew up with
380:26
[Music]
380:28
she's gone forever now
380:31
[Music]
380:34
nothing i can do to bring her back
380:38
[Music]
380:40
this is this isn't some game where i can
380:43
just reset and try something different
380:46
i had only one chance and i wasn't
380:48
careful enough
380:51
and now i will carry the skill with me
380:52
until i die
380:55
nothing in my life is worth more than
380:57
hers
380:59
[Music]
381:00
but i still couldn't do what she needed
381:02
for me
381:04
and now
381:05
i can never take it back
381:07
never
381:09
ever
381:10
ever
381:12
ever
381:14

382:43
quarter
382:44
that is not one quarter dude what
382:48
it's
382:49
you're right it's it's a visual novel
382:53
probably does take a lot a long time
382:56
[Music]
382:58
but chad i wanted to do this in one
382:59
whole stream
383:01
[Music]
383:02
wait what what's the difference between
383:04
uh between normal
383:07
normal doki doki and plus
383:16
[Music]
383:20
hi elira
383:22
i'm so [ __ ] tired
383:26
it's 40 side stories i see
383:31
[Music]
383:52
i see an annoying girl running towards
383:54
me from the distance waving her arms in
383:55
the air like she's totally oblivious to
383:58
any attention she might draw to herself
384:01
that girl
384:03
my neighbor and a good friend since we
384:05
were children
384:06
you know the kind of friend you never
384:07
see yourself making today but it just
384:09
kind of works out because you've known
384:10
each other for so long
384:12
we used to walk to school together on
384:14
days like this but starting around high
384:16
school we would oversl
384:18
it's the whole game this is just the
384:20
whole game like times times four
384:23
[Music]
384:25
well he's tired of waiting up
384:27
but she's going to chase me after this i
384:29
almost feel better running halfway
384:31
however
384:32
i just saw an idol in front of the
384:34
crosswalk and let's
384:36
catch up with me
384:38
oh
384:40
what's wrong with the game
384:46
it's an ordinary school day like any
384:48
other
384:49
mornings
384:50
are usually the worst being surrounded
384:52
by couples and friends groups walking to
384:54
school together meanwhile always walk to
384:57
school alone
384:58
always tell myself about it it's about
385:01
time i meet some girls or something like
385:02
that
385:03
but i have no motivation to join any
385:06
clubs
385:07
i'm perfectly content with getting on
385:10
getting by on average while spending my
385:12
free time on games and anime
385:15
there's always the anime club
385:17
and it's not like there's any girls in
385:19
it anyway
385:23
oh it's new it's new
385:25
look at eat please i'm fine guys
385:29
you have a collab later yeah in like 12
385:31
hours
385:33
after i pack my things i stand blankly
385:35
at the wall looking for an ounce of
385:37
motivation
385:38
clubs
385:39
there really aren't any that interests
385:41
me
385:42
besides most of them would probably be
385:45
way too demanding for me to want to deal
385:47
with
385:49
i guess i have no choice but to start
385:50
with the enemy club
385:52
luka

387:28
until the next hour
387:29
for 30 more minutes
387:31
we didn't know each other well we really
387:33
talked but we were in the same class
387:35
last year monica was probably the most
387:37
popular going class my beautiful
387:38
athletic
387:40
basically completely out of my league
387:43
so having her smile at me is so
387:44
genuinely feels a little
387:46
what did you come in what did you come
387:48
in here for anyway oh i've just been
387:50
looking for some supplies for use for
387:52
the club
387:53
you know if there's any construction
387:55
paper here
387:56
or markers
387:59
i guess you could check the closet
388:01
you're in the debate club right what is
388:04
this game
388:06
what is happening
388:09
about that
388:11
i actually quit the debate club
388:13
really you could
388:19
to be honest i can't send all of the
388:21
politics around the major clubs
388:24
it feels like nothing
388:26
but arguing about the budget and
388:27
publicity and how to prepare for events
388:30
prepare for events
388:32
i'd much rather take something
388:34
personally
388:35
i personally enjoy
388:37
and make something special out of it
388:39
now in case a club please even
388:43
what club did you decide to join
388:49
actually
388:51
i'm i'm starting actually
388:53
i'm starting a new one
388:56
what
388:58
a literature club literature
389:01
it sounds kind of dull
389:02
how many members do you have so far um
389:06
it's kind of embarrassing but there are
389:08
only three of us so far
389:10
it's really hard to find new members for
389:11
something fun that sounds so boring
389:16
well i can see that
389:18
but it's really not boring at all you
389:20
know
389:21
literature can be anything
389:24
reading
389:25
writing
389:26
poetry
389:27
i mean one of my members
389:29
even keeps her manga collection in the
389:32
in the club room
389:34
wait really
389:35
yeah it's funny right
389:37
she always insists that mong is
389:39
literature too
389:40
i mean she's not wrong i guess
389:42
and besides a member is a member right
389:45
did monica say she
389:50
hey luca
389:52
you have a chance are you are you still
389:53
looking for a club to join
389:55
uh
389:56
i mean i guess so but
389:59
in that case
390:00
is there any chance you could do me a
390:02
big favor
390:04
i want to ask you to join but
390:06
you could
390:07
be fairly less
390:10
very least visit my club
390:12
it would make me really happy
390:15
please
390:18
um
390:19
well i guess i have no reason to refuse
390:23
[Music]
390:24
besides how could i ever refuse someone
390:26
like monica
390:28
sure i got some check it out
390:31
don't oh awesome
390:34
you really are sweet oh my god you know
390:35
that
390:36
it's nothing really
390:39
shall we go shall we go then
390:41
i'll look for the materials another time
390:43
you're more important
390:46
gotta go luca see you later
390:50
and thus today marks the day i sold my
390:52
soul to monica and her irresistible
390:55
smile
390:59
i dejectedly follow monica across the
391:01
school upstairs in a section of school i
391:04
rarely visit monica full of energy
391:07
swings the classroom door
391:10
what the [ __ ] is going on
391:14
guys something's wrong with my game
391:18
hold alone
391:19
[Music]
391:25
going on
391:27
[Music]
391:28
it's normal
391:33
[Music]
391:35
game seems normal to me
391:37
okay
391:39
i'm back
391:41
and i brought a guest with me
391:43
oh [ __ ]
391:46
huh
391:50
i guessed
391:52
seriously you want a boy
391:56
way to kill the atmosphere
391:59
don't be mean natsuki
392:01
anyway welcome to the club luca
392:04
oh words escaped me in the situation
392:07
this club
392:11
is
392:12
full of
392:13
incredibly cute girls girls girls
392:23
so let me guess
392:25
you're monica's boyfriend right
392:27
what
392:29
no i'm not
392:30
natsuki
392:32
the girl with a sound attitude his name
392:34
is apparently natsuki is one i don't
392:35
recognize
392:36
a small figure makes her look like a
392:38
first-year student
392:41
anyways this is natsuki energetic as
392:44
usual
392:45
and this is yuri the vice vice president
392:48
it's nice to meet you
392:52
yuri who appears more comparably more
392:53
mature and timid seems to have a hard
392:55
time keeping up with someone like
392:57
natsuki
392:58
it's nice to meet both of you
393:00
so i ran into so i ran to luca in the
393:03
classroom and he decided to come check
393:05
the club check out the club
393:08
isn't that great
393:11
wait
393:12
wait monica
393:14
did i tell you to let me know in advance
393:16
before you brought anyone new
393:19
i was going too well you know
393:22
sorry sorry
393:23
i didn't forget that but i just happened
393:25
to run into him
393:26
[Music]
393:28
and in that case
393:30
i should at least make some tea right
393:32
yeah that would be great
393:35
why don't you come sit down luka
393:42
the girls have a few desks arranged to
393:44
form a table
393:46
yuri walks to the corner of the room and
393:48
opens the closet
393:50
meanwhile monica natsuki sent across
393:53
from each other
393:54
still feeling awkward i take i take i
393:56
take a seat next to monica
393:59
so i know you didn't really plan on
394:00
coming here
394:02
but
394:02
we'll make sure you feel right at home
394:04
right okay
394:06
as president of the literature club it's
394:08
my duty to make the club fun and
394:10
exciting for everyone
394:13
i'm surprised there aren't more people
394:14
in the club yet it must be hard to start
394:16
a new club
394:17
we could put it that way
394:19
how many people are very interested in
